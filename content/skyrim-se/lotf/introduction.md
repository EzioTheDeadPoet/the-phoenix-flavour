## About Legends of the Frost

*What if Skyrim, but better?*

**Legends of the Frost** (LOTF) is a Wabbajack list for Skyrim SE. It is the lightest list I could conceive of, designed to be as close to vanilla as possible while bringing some much needed improvements to texture sharpness, distant terrain, and certain gameplay mechanics. I created it because for all my years of ~~playing~~ modding Skyrim SE I never finished the main quest once. With any other setup, I get caught in the same loop as most people: Updating, rebuilding, starting over again. LOTF is my attempt to fix that.

- **LOTF** is a small list in scope, strictly limited to fixing vanilla annoyances.
- **LOTF** features better distant terrain, sharper textures, and improved combat.
- **LOTF** is lightly customisable, including performance, interface, and gameplay adjustments.
- **LOTF** will not receive updates requiring a new save for the forseeable future.

### Features

- All essentials are installed, including the Skyrim Script Extender, the USSEP, SSE Engine Fixes, SSE Display Tweaks, etc.
- Includes a plethora of additional fixes and tweaks for a smoother vanilla-like experience.
- Fixed green-tinted blonde hair, weirdly bright falling leaves at night, and more.
- **More lush trees, actually 3D roads, less oily water**, and many other visual improvements.
- High quality texture overhaul for many objects provided by [Skyland AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34179).
- All remaining textures replaced by cleaned and upscaled versions, courtesy of the [Project Clarity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755?tab=user+files) series.
- Improved weathers and lighting with [RAID Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63116) and the full suite of shader tweaks based on [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492) by doodlez.
- Modern interface thanks to [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604). The HUD is toggleable with [Ultimate Immersion Toggle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62117). Better [Reading UI](https://imgsli.com/NzAzOTc).
- More resource management-oriented combat with [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) (and vanilla damage modifiers).
- Better sound quality with [Audio Overhaul for Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466).
- **Optional Widescreen support** (for 2560x1080 or 3440x1440 monitors).

Legends of the Frost features rebuilt terrain LOD with [SSELODGen](https://stepmodifications.org/forum/topic/13451-xlodgen-terrain-lod-beta-84-for-fnv-fo3-fo4-fo4vr-tes5-sse-tes5vr-enderal-enderalse/?ct=1629204990) as well as highly improved object LOD and hybrid tree LOD generated with [DynDOLOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32382). All facegen for vanilla NPCs was recreated at twice the vanilla resolution with higher quality assets.

### Performance

LOTF has **no significant performance impact**. It was not designed to be a "lite" list but the absence of an ENB preset as well as the optional performance tweaks should still make the list more than playable on all but the weakest PCs. While I relied almost exclusively on **Skyland AIO** and **Project Clarity** for textures with largely vanilla-sized textures, DynDOLOD does increase the amount of VRAM required.

I personally play @1440p60FPS on a rather high-end PC (i7 10700k, RTX 3080) and barely ever dropped below 144FPS when I uncapped the framerate for testing purposes. The framerate is capped at 60FPS by default which should be very achievable for most PCs.

~~Since LOTF 2.0, there is now an optional **performance profile** included. The INI settings were toned down and DynDOLOD was regenerated on Medium with less demanding mesh rules for trees.~~

Since LOTF 3.1, the performance profile has been abolished; however, the DynDOLOD output is now always using medium mesh rules and there are optional performance INIs available.

### About the name

Just like my Fallout 4 list is named after one of my favourite songs, I picked "Legends of the Frost" as tribute to the incredible [Miracle of Sound](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSfoxYTlCPFfglckBLrjpsA) (he's brilliant and you should check him out!). Way back in 2012, he collaborated with the equally amazing [Malukah](https://www.youtube.com/user/malufenix) on a Skyrim-themed song called, you guessed it, [Legends of the Frost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FLQ4rACE-0). Though it is one of his older songs, it holds up very well and I love how perfectly he captured the atmosphere of the game (as he always does).

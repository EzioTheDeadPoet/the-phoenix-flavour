## Are LOTF updates save-safe / can I continue my playthrough?

If an update requires a new save this is noted in the changelog.

## How can I improve performance / increase my frame rate?

I recommend replacing your INIs with the performance set. You can find instructions for that [here](/lotf/customisation/#performance-inis).

## I encountered a bug / issue / inconsistency. What do I do?

Please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xRrHRsb5e9) and post about what you encountered in the `#lotf-support` forum. Add screenshots if possible.

If there is no immediate response, please be patient. I or someone else will respond to you when we can.

## Oh no, the game crashed! What do I do?

Generally speaking, a single random crash is no cause for worry. I usually start investigating if there is a second crash within a few hours or the crash is repeatable. That being said, I have had no crashes at all in some 90 hours of playing LOTF, so any crash reports are welcome.

- To submit crash reports, please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xRrHRsb5e9).
- Find the `#lotf-support` forum and create a new post.
- Add your most recent crashlog `Crash-202x-xxxx.txt` to the post.
- Briefly describe the circumstances under which it happened.

Crash logs can be found inside the `/NetScriptFramework/Crash/` folder in the **Overwrite**. You can find the **Overwrite** by scrolling all the way down in Mod Organizers' left pane.

> Do not report crashes that occured in a modified setup of LOTF (with added / removed mods). **Modified setups are not supported.**

## What is that weird blur / depth of field effect ingame?

Although it is possible to disable Skyrim's questionable depth of field in the INIs, doing so breaks underwater visuals (makes underwater look perfectly clear). However, I still strongly recommend turning down the DOF slider all the way down ingame. If you want a depth of field effect for pretty screenshots, you can enable DOF in Weather Is Sacred ENB.

## Can I add my own mods on top of LOTF?

If you have to ask, probably not.

Regardless of whether you are building a custom setup or modifying an existing one (like LOTF), you need to understand how mods function, how they interact, and how they can be edited. Adding mods is not a matter of dropping them in MO2 and doing a cursory ingame check. Issues may not present themselves immediately or you may have inadvertently broken something else.

**There is no support for modifying setups or issues occuring in a modified setup.**

That being said, modding is fun and you should learn it! There are some great resources out there that you can start out with:

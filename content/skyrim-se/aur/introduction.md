  About Aurora - A Visual Overhaul.
---

**Aurora** is a Wabbajack visuals-only list for Skyrim Special Edition with an emphasis on consistency. It is based on [Skyrim Modding Essentials](/skyrim-se/aur/introduction/) and contains the same fixes and tools, including widescreen support; however, no changes were made to gameplay, interface, content integration, etc.

Due to the nature of the list, I expect that most users will use it as a base for their own setup. As such, it requires the same disclaimer as SME: I will provide no support whatsoever for anything beyond the setup itself, I am not responsible for your modifications. That being said, Aurora is fully documented which should help in building off it.

> Skyrim SE 1.6.x on Steam and the full Anniversary Edition DLC are required.

Aurora is [fully documented](https://publish.obsidian.md/tpf/home).

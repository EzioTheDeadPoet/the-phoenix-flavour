## Backstory

As far back as you can remember you were called a "stray cat." The words were full of malice from the Nords who spoke them. You were an orphan far away from your supposed native land of Elsweyr, but Elsweyr is a mystery to you. You're much more acquainted with the towering stone walls of Markarth, the busy markets of Whiterun, and the gentle breeze of the Rift. Skyrim is your home as much as it's anyone else's, but no matter where you go you're seen as an outsider.


Your life was spent bouncing from hold to hold with a shovel over your shoulder, ready to tackle the dirty tasks no one else wanted. More often than not you filled the role of a grave digger, shoveling through frozen soil to either bury an unfortunate fool or dig out another milkdrinker's misplaced heirloom. It was dull, demeaning work, and you were often neglected by your patrons, much like everything else forgotten in the barrows you were sent to. But where they saw filth, you saw potential.
 

You saw ancient Nord armors and weapons that could be salvaged and put to use. Gems that could be mined. Corpses that could be raised if you could wrap your mind around the necromancy necessary. You were ready to bide your time and gather strength in Skyrim's dusty crypts until you were a force that could no longer be overlooked.
 

But first, you'll have to escape these bindings. It seems these Imperials are just the next on a long list of those who think you're a foreigner here...


## Summary

* **Complexity:** Low
* **Race:** [Khajiit](## "Major Skill: Hand to Hand
Minor Skills: Alchemy, Archery, Light Armor, Security, Sneak
Lunar Blessing: You move 10% faster and take 50% less damage from falling. You also spend 25% less Stamina when power attacking or drawing a bow.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Conjuration, Two-handed  
  * **Defensive:** Block, Heavy Armor  
  * **Utility:** Enchanting, Security
* **Attributes:**  
You'll need health to stand toe to toe with foes, magicka to maintain your minions, and stamina to swing your axe. There's not too much wiggle room here, unfortunately.
  * **Health:** 4 (40%)
  * **Magicka:** 3 (30%)
  * **Stamina:** 3 (30%)

You're a resourceful kitten first and foremost, and little is off the table when it comes to defending yourself. Raise a fallen enemy to fight their former allies if need be, then swoop in for the killing blow on the weakened foe. Eventually you'll be a enduring juggernaut of your own, keeping your opponents occupied in melee while your thralls ravage from the flank. And when you master the arts of enchanting and necromancy, you'll be able to equip your permanent minions in masterfully imbued gear, making them even more vicious.

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-warrior.webp">

#### The Warrior (Guardian)

***Warborn:*** *Your Health is increased by 50, and blocking is 25% more effective.*

Starting out you'll have little to work with. Bolster your health and blocking so you'll be able to man the frontlines and live to see better days.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-ritual.webp">

#### The Ritual

***Mother’s Sorrow:*** *You can summon or reanimate one additional minion, but your summoning and reanimation spells last half as long.*

Bodies are plentiful enough. Don't get attached to them and raise as many as you need to overpower your enemies. This trade is even more beneficial in the late game when your summons are more powerful and last even longer.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-tower.webp">

#### The Tower

***Warden’s Wall:*** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 100, and you reflect 100% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.*

Put your heavy armor to even more use by reflecting back the damage you invite. Tanking damage in lieu of your zombies keeps them alive longer, and keeping them alive means they put out more damage of their own. This choice can greatly boost your damage output if you can handle it.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

The Nine never answered your prayers and their priests paid you no mind except for devouts of Arkay who needed a hole dug. You idolized those who seized power for themselves like **Mannimarco**, King of Worms. **Namiira** of the Dark Spirits was also worth your attention as you believe she'd claim you in the afterlife. And who could forgot **Molagh** when speaking of dominating all others?

<details>

#### Mannimarco

*Your Conjuration spells cost 20% less. You can reanimate two additional zombies, but when you do not control at least one reanimated zombie, your Armor Rating is reduced by 300 and your Magic Resistance is reduced by 50%.*

Mannimarco is a obvious choice for necromancers. The downside is barely a hurdle as you'll be able to find a corpse nearly anywhere if not make one quickly enough. Just take care not to encounter any dragons unaccompanied.

#### Molag Bal

*You have 50 extra Magicka. You cannot regenerate Magicka in combat, but you absorb 20 points of Magicka per second from nearby enemies.*

You're someone who loves to take what's other's and put it to use. Molagh helps you do that with Magicka. The downside puts a damper on your ability to raise corpses if you're unable to drain enough from your enemies.

#### Namira

*You have 100% Disease Resistance. When you feed on a corpse, your Health regenerates twice as fast. When you have not fed, you cannot regenerate Health.*

Namiira can be a darker turn for the build by adding another layer of usefulness to corpses. The health regeneration complements your heavy armor perks well and the disease resistance seems fitting for someone who spends lots of time in tombs.

### Conjuration

Conjuration is the glue between your martial abilities and your enchanting studies. Without it you'll have no one watching your back and no reliable way to fill your soul gems. With it, well, you're a force to be reckoned with.

* **Soul Trap (Novice+):** *If a target dies within 60 seconds, fills a soul gem.*  
  You'll need soul gems for enchanting and this is a solid way of obtaining the.

* **Raise Zombie (Novice+):** *Reanimates a corpse up to level 5 for 120 seconds.*  
  You may be tempted to summon something to do your bidding but using material that's already around is better for the environment.

* **Daedric Cure (Adept+):** *Restores 20 Health per second to nearby summoned creatures and reanimated zombies.*  
  Especially potent if you went the Mannimarco route, this will keep your horde moving in top condition.

### Dragon Shouts

**Battle Fury:** *Nearby ally's weapons are 50% faster for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
Your minions count as allies and they tend to carry weapons. A 50% boost is nothing to sneeze at, especially with a 50% or better uptime.

**Drain Vitality<sup>DG</sup>:** *Absorbs 5 Stamina\Magicka\Health for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
Your whole schtick is taking from what's around you. With this you can sustain yourself off your assailants.

**Soul Tear<sup>DG</sup>:** *Deals 30\60\120 damage. Fills a soul gem if the target dies within 10\20\30 seconds. \Permanently reanimates a corpse up to level 50.*  
Damages enemies, fills your soul gems, and can raise a corpse automatically for you with the 3rd word? Talk about efficiency! Don't hesitate to open up encounters with is one as you might instantly turn an enemy on their friends.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **Soul Trap:** *Fills a soul gem if the target dies within 30 seconds.*
* **Damage Armor:** *Reduces enemy Armor Rating by 150 for 30 seconds.*
* **Paralyze:** *Living targets up to level 40 have a 25% chance to be paralyzed for 10 seconds.*

Automatically filling your soul gems will do wonders for your Enchanting experience. Otherwise, the offensive option is to remove the enemy's armor and the defensive would be crowd control via paralysis. *Fear* also works but you'll want to keep foes within cleave range.

#### Head

* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Fortify Block:** *You block 25% more damage.*
* **Reflect Damage:** *You reflect 50% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.*

A 25% boost to a monstrous swing is a solid return on investment. Your other options include blocking damage or taking it to give back. You can't really go wrong with either choice though one requires you to actually block the incoming attacks.

#### Chest

* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Reflect Damage:** *You reflect 50% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*

With a great weapon your power attacks are frightening. Boosting them makes them even more so. Reflecting damage back at attackers is tempting alternative, and you're sturdy enough to do it, but you could always be sturdier against mages. 

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Two-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with Two-handed weapons.*
* **Fortify Lockpicking:** *You are 25% better at lockpicking.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*

If you're having trouble with locks this is one way to help yourself. As returns on that enchantment diminish, consider switching to the solid damage option or boosting your elemental resistance.

#### Boots

* **Fortify Carry Weight:** *Your Carry Weight is increased by 50.*
* **Fortify Stamina:** *Your Stamina is increased by 50.*
* **Fortify Stamina Regeneration:** *Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*

The perk build skipped over *Extra Pockets*, so this is a place where you can secure more carry weight for all the extra loot you find. If you don't need it, focusing on Stamina will allow you to power attack more frequently.

#### Necklace

* **Resist Disease:** *Your Disease Resistance is increased by 100%.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Block:** *You receive 25% better prices.*

This build expects to be on the frontlines taking plenty of hits. Unless you have something like *Namira's* additional blessing that leaves you open to a lot of diseases. It's not a conventional choice but it will save you a lot of headaches.

#### Ring

* **Fortify Two-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with Two-handed weapons.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Resist Disease:** *Your Disease Resistance is increased by 100%.*

If you don't have disease resistance elsewherein the build, grab it. Otherwise, boost your main source of damage or bolster your magic defense.

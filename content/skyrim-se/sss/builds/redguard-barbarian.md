## Backstory

In Sentinel, a city steeped in ancient wisdom, a saying echoes through the hearts of its people: "The strongest steel is forged in the fiercest fires." These words, older than time itself, resonated with you as you tirelessly trained alongside the valiant warriors of Tava's tribe. However, the once-proud order had withered, dwindling in size until it no longer retained its former glory. It was a mere shadow, a remnant of what it used to be. The elders seemed content with mediocrity, lacking the spark needed to ignite greatness. And so, you set forth in search of that vital flame, elsewhere.

Under the guidance of Captain of the Eastway, your journey to Windhelm, the seat of Ulfric Stormcloak, promised smooth passage. There, amidst the ancient city's whispers and secrets, you sought Darkwater Crossing, hoping to cross paths with the formidable Ulfric himself and pledge your unwavering allegiance to his noble cause. Destiny led you to him, but alas, your impeccable timing unwittingly thrust you into an Imperial trap, meticulously laid in Ulfric's path.

Now, as your captors guide you through the unfamiliar and frigid terrain, uncertainty fills your heart. Yet, one truth burns within you like an eternal flame: if fate should ever place a sword back into your hands, this will be the final time the Empire holds sway over your destiny. Determination flickers in your eyes, for you are a soul shaped by the hottest fires, a warrior yearning to rewrite the pages of history and reclaim your own power.

    Martial Training: Your Stamina is increased by 50 and your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Destruction, One-handed  
  * **Defensive:** Light Armor, Restoration  
  * **Utility:** Alteration, Smithing
* **Attributes:**  
You'll get a large boost to Stamina from your race and the Thief Stone. Use the opportunity to boost Health and Magicka early. Lightning Cloak will need a decent investment before you get Elementalist 2.

Tava's spirit flows through you and, through you, your blades. You are the storm itself, a whirlwind of blades that wears down the defense of anyone unfortunate enough to meet it.

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-thief.webp">

#### The Thief (Guardian)

***Cheater’s Luck:*** *Your Stamina is increased by 50, you move 10% faster, and you take 50% less damage from falling.*

Extra Stamina is just what you need out of the gate. The extra movespeed helps you get into your opponents' faces and chase them down if they retreat. This blessing is equivalent to *Kynareth's* later on when you have *Pilgrim (Rank 2)*, coincidentally. It's almost as if Tava herself is watching over you.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-lover.webp">

#### The Lover

***Lover's Touch:*** *Your Stamina regenerates twice as fast, but you cannot gain any bonuses from sleeping.*

Later on you'll have enough Stamina in your pool and Stamina Regeneration will be more important. Lover's Touch will give you plenty of Stamina Regeneration to work with, allowing you to continue your onslaught for much longer.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-steed.webp">

#### The Steed

***Charioteer:*** *You move 20% faster and your Carry Weight is increased by 100. *

Movement speed gets you into your preferred range quickly and allows you to weave in and out of attacks with more ease. The Steed will not only help you out immensely in that regard but it will boost your Carry Weight a large amount as well, allowing you to bring back more spoils from your victories.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

Hailing from Hammerfell, you brought your beliefs with you on the Eastway and have no inclination to change your ways. **Tava**, called Kynareth here in Skyrim, is held closest to your heart and is the source of your inner storm. Defeating the Thalmor infidels in **HoonDing's** name is what brought you here to begin with. And one can never forget **Ruptga**, or Tall Papa, who is ever present.

<details>

#### HoonDing

*Your Stamina is increased by 50. You attack 20% faster when wielding a One-handed weapon with an empty offhand.*

HoonDing is no Tava but in the early game he'll provide the same benefit and his cause is just as righteous. The Thalmor your people have driven out of Hammerfell need to be pushed out of Skyrim as well. His *Pilgrim (Rank 2)* effect is unfortunate, however, since you'll want to be dual-wielding at that point in your adventure.

#### Kynareth

*Your Stamina is increased by 50. You move 10% faster and take 50% less damage from falling.*

Tava, the goddess of air, weather and sun is thematically the true option for this build. With *Pilgrim (Rank 2)* you'll be granted extra speed from the goddess. Use it along with other boosts to stay in your opponents' faces where it's most perilous for them.

#### Tall Papa

*You gain 20% more experience. You have an additional unique effect based on your Standing Stone.*

Tall Papa's' experience bonus is almost always beneficial. His additional effects are all useful as well, especially for *Steed Stone* users who want as much speed as possible.  
* **The Lady Stone:** You have 25 extra Health, Magicka, and Stamina.  
* **The Thief Stone:** You spend 25% less Stamina when power attacking or drawing a bow.  
* **The Steed Stone:** You move 10% faster, and your carry weight is increased by 50.

## Spellbook

> Full magic information can be found on the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-alteration.webp">

### Alteration

This school provides a bag of useful tricks. Just don't waste too much time or Magicka casting them in lieu of better options. Below are key spells you should consider using. Feel free to grab other utility spells so they're available if the need arises.

* **Oakflesh (Novice+):** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 40 for 120 seconds.*  
  These are great early on when your defenses are lacking. Their oomph falls off later when your Light Armor perks start coming together.

* **Whirlwind Cloak (Adept):** *For 60 seconds, enemies in melee range have a chance to be knocked down.*  
  Perfect for managing a mob of enemies and thematic to boot. Keep this in your back pocket for tougher situations where you need additional crowd control.

* **Weakness to Shock (Expert):** *You reduce enemy Shock Resistance by 50% for 60 seconds.*  
  Don't bother using this outside of boss battles. In those longer fights, the extra damage from your Shock magic will make a noticeable difference.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-destruction.webp">

### Destruction

Shock magic is the manifestation of Tava's storm. It also serves as your main source of ranged damage when necessary. Nearly any Shock spell is viable with this build as you'll have all of the relevant Destruction perks... take care not to confuse yourself for a mage.

* **Sparks (Novice+):** *Deals 8 Shock damage per second to Health and Magicka.*  
  Simple and effective but it will drain your Magicka battery quickly.

* **Lightning Bolt (Apprentice+):** *Deals 20 Shock damage to Health and Magicka.*  
  Your option for pesky, distant or otherwise hard to reach enemies. If mages don't die from this their Magicka reserves will be drained, making it more likely they'll come closer.

* **Lightning Cloak (Adept):** *For 60 seconds, nearby enemies take 8 Shock damage per second to Health and Magicka.*  
  You'll want this active whenever you run into combat. Between this and your swords, anything in close proximity to you will have a hard time holding onto life.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-restoration.webp">

### Restoration

Restoration keeps you on your feet. With dual blades, you'll be casting most of these spells before or after combat as trying to heal in the fray will greatly diminish your damage output. With *Respite*, many of these spells will also restore Stamina if you're running low.

* **Healing (Novice+):** *Restores 10 Health per second.*  
  The healing over time factor makes this less than ideal but it's the only choice at the start.

* **Close Wounds (Apprentice+):** *Restores 40 Health.*  
  Instant healing will get your swords back in hand faster. If your Magicka supplies are full enough this is the ideal healing option.

* **Regeneration (Apprentice+):** *Restores 2 Health per second for 120 seconds.*  
  This does not work with *Respite* but can help with sustainability if you expect a long encounter. Use this right before a tough fight and your Magicka should recover before you'll need additional healing.

</details>

## Dragon Shouts

> Full dragon shout information can be found on the [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) description page.

<details>

#### Cyclone<sup>DB</sup>
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*  

* **Ven:** *Deals 50 Magic damage and knocks down enemies in a small area.*
* **Gaar:** *Deals 75 Magic damage and knocks down enemies in a large area.*
* **Nos:** *Deals 100 Magic damage and knocks down enemies in a massive area.*
* **Meditation:** *Cyclone deals extra damage over 10 seconds.*

More thematic than *Unrelenting Force* but with a longer cooldown. In exchange, it packs a strong punch that will definitely help clear a room.

#### Storm Call
*Cooldown: 180/240/300 seconds*

* **Strun:** *Calls a storm for 30 seconds. Lightning bolts from the storm deal 50 damage.*
* **Bah:** *Calls a storm for 45 seconds. Lightning bolts from the storm deal 75 damage.*
* **Qo:** *Calls a storm for 60 seconds. Lightning bolts from the storm deal 100 damage.*

If you're not traveling with a companion, this is your go-to offensive shout. Call down Tava's rage to devastate the battlefield as you dance through it. If you are traveling with a companion this will probably kill them.

#### Whirlwind Sprint
*Cooldown: 10/20/30 seconds*

* **Wuld:** *Rush forward by 30 feet.*
* **Nah:** *Rush forward by 40 feet.*
* **Kest:** *Rush forward by 50 feet.*
  
This will help you quickly close the distance with archers and mages, putting you in position to do what you're best at.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **Absorb Health:** *Absorbs 20 Health.*
* **Absorb Stamina:** *Absorbs 30 Stamina.*
* **Damage Armor:** *Reduces enemy Armor Rating by 150 for 30 seconds.*

While tempting to ride the lightning further with Shock enchantments, your weapons are better used to sustain you. If extra sustainability isn't needed, you can drop one to weaken your enemy's armor instead and deal more damage.

#### Head

* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Fortify Destruction Cost:** *Your Destruction spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Armor Rating:** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 100.*

Most of your damage will come from melee power attacks so it's a safe choice to go with. If that's not available, making your Shock spells easier to cast can be useful. Failing either, it never hurts to bolster your armor in case you're hit.

#### Chest

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Resist Stagger:** *You resist 25% of incoming stagger and take 25% less damage while staggered.*

Being out in the open makes you an easy target for magic users. Improving your general resistance will allow you to eat the damage and continue your assault, most likely healing yourself in the process. If you find yourself getting staggered often and unable to keep up the assault, there's the third option.

#### Gloves

* **Fortify One-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with One-handed weapons.*
* **Fortify Magicka:** *Your Magicka is increased by 50.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*

This is a rare opportunity to boost your One-handed damage and you should take it. Alternatively, boosting your Magicka pool is worth it if it allows you to cast a more expensive spell such as *Lightning Cloak*. Or you can shore up an elemental resistance as that never hurts to have.

#### Boots

* **Fortify Movement Speed:** *Your Movement Speed is increased by 20%.*
* **Fortify Stamina:** *Your Stamina is increased by 50.*
* **Fortify Stamina Regeneration:** *Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*

The options here aren't exciting but they aren't without usefulness. More Movement Speed keeps you on top of your enemies. And more Stamina (or regeneration) means more power attacks which means more devastation.

#### Necklace

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Resist Stagger:** *You resist 25% of incoming stagger and take 25% less damage while staggered.*

More Magic Resistance is always welcome unless you're already at the 75% cap. If so, this is one of the few places where you can add more Shock damage. Failing both of those, additional Stagger resistance always helps. An Amulet of Kynareth can serve as a low-level option as Tava'll boost your stamina pool.

#### Ring

* **Fortify One-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with One-handed weapons.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*

A competitive enchantment slot and you can't go wrong with any option. Your bread and butter is One-handed, though, and this is one of two places where you can improve it.

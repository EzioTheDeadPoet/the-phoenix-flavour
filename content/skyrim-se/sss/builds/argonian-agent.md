![Argonian Agent](/Pictures/sss/builds/argonian-agent-art.png)


Ulfric Stormcloak made his stance perfectly clear when he barred Argonians from living inside the safety of Windhelm's walls. You were a second class citizen of Skyrim at best. If he has his way, if he wins this war he's picked with the Imperials, you might find yourself not a citizen at all. You live a life that barely qualifies as living, either used as a pack mule for the city or too doped on skooma to be of any use to the Nords. You preferred the former, holding your tongue and working the docks, waiting and hoping for an opportunity to seize something better.


It presented itself in the form of a Stormcloak supply run. Or that's what you thought it was when you had a friend pack you into a crate and load it up into a wagon. The plan was to let yourself out at nightfall and slip off into the woods, perhaps relocating to Riften where your street knowledge could be put to use. But the plan didn't account for Ulfric being part of the escort, let alone the Imperials ambushing it. But maybe, with continued patience, another opportunity will come...

## Summary

* **Complexity:** Moderate
* **Race:** [Argonian](## "Major Skill: Alchemy
Minor Skills: Alteration, Illusion, Security, Restoration, Sneak
Histskin: Your Poison Resistance and Disease Resistance are increased by 50%, and your potions last 50% longer. You can also breathe underwater.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Alchemy, Restoration  
  * **Defensive:** Illusion, Alteration  
  * **Utility:** Security, Sneak
* **Attributes:**  
Most of what you do will require Magicka so you don't want to ignore it. That said, Health and Stamina are still important for survival and increasing your carry weight.
  * **Health:** 2 (25%)
  * **Magicka:** 4 (45%)
  * **Stamina:** 3 (30%)

The agent is unassuming, walking into situations without weapons or armor, dressed in cloth and a smile. Ideally, you'll use your Illusion magic to bolster your follower and let them dirty their hands. Or drive your enemies into a frenzy and observe the bloodbath. But life will not always be so convenient. From time to time you'll need to do the killing yourself with the use of poison (Restoration) magic, all while keeping yourself save with Alteration. In cities, where such acts are frowned upon by the guards, you'll be able to employ subtler ways of applying poison. Whatever you choose, leave no witnesses.

## Perks

</details>

### Late Game: Scatheclaw

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-mage.webp">

#### The Mage (Guardian)

***Path of Wisdom:*** *Your Magicka is increased by 50, and your spells and enchantments cost 10% less.*

The Mage Stone is the ideal starting stone for you. Though the agent is technically a Stealth class the benefits of the Thief Stone aren't too beneficial. Feel free to carry this blessing into the mid game.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-serpent.webp">

#### The Serpent

***Serpent’s Kiss:*** *Your Poison Resistance is increased by 50%, your potions last 50% longer, and your poisons last for two additional hits.*

The Serpent Stone is hit or miss for this build, ironically. An additional hit of poison can be great if you're stabbing your victims instead of reverse pickpocketing. Otherwise this does next to nothing for you.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-shadow.webp">

#### The Shadow

***Moonshadow:*** *You are 25% harder to detect while sneaking, and you deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*

If you run into problems sneaking, the Shadow Stone is your best friend. It will help you stay hidden and boost your spellpower at the same time.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

You've no love for this realm nor its deities. And if you were born in Skyrim, and thus *lukiul*, you could not hear the Hist the way others do. Nonetheless, you know that the Hist acknowledges **Sithis** so, in turn, he is the only "higher being" you deign to revere. 

<details>

#### Sithis

*You are 10% better at sneaking.*

The Dark Brotherhood is a natural fit for you and Sithis is a natural fit for the Dark Brotherhood. Boost to Sneak are always welcome and, since you're not getting any *Pilgrim* or *Cultist* perks, this is about as perfect as it gets.

</details>

## Spellbook

> Full magic information can be found on the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) description page. Additionally, dragon shout information can be found on the [Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-alteration.webp">

### Alteration

Your investment in Alteration is mainly for the Magicka benefits however there's no reason not to pick up a few useful spells along the way. Feel free to grab any number of utility spells to help level this skill during your travels.

* **Oakflesh (Novice+):** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 40 for 120 seconds.*  
  Early on you might find yourself in more scuffles than you'd like. This will give you some protection. Just don't rely on it later in the game.

* **Open Novice Lock (Novice+):** *You can open any lock of Novice difficulty for 30 seconds.*  
  You skipped the lockpicking side of Security for a reason. This is it.

* **Weakness to Poison (Expert):** *You reduce enemy Poison Resistance by 50% for 60 seconds.*  
  You mainly output Poison damage so it would be problematic if the enemy was resistant. Why take a chance when you can be sure they aren't?

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-illusion.webp">

### Illusion

Sometimes it's impossible to sneak up on everyone in a room but if it's possible to influence one of them that might just be enough. Illusion will allow you to cause mayhem from afar, thinning the herd before you enter and clean up the rest. The rune variety of spells at Expert level are tempting but without revealing yourself it'll be hard to get enemies to walk into them.

* **Frenzy (Novice+):** *Living targets up to level 5 will attack anyone nearby for 30 seconds.*  
  If they can't see you they have no choice but to attack someone else. Likely an ally.

* **Fear (Apprentice+):** *Living targets up to level 10 flee from combat for 30 seconds.*  
  A useful spell to have in your back pocket if you have a pressing need for less attention.

* **Command (Adept+):** *Living targets up to level 15 are placed under your command for 30 seconds.*  
  This gives you more control than *Frenzy* but you'll have to do something with your new companion before their senses return.

* **Invisibility (Expert+):** *For 30 seconds, you cannot be seen or heard. Activating an object or attacking will break this spell.*  
  For when you absolutely need to vanish and reset the situation.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-restoration.webp">

### Restoration

You'll rarely be using this to heal someone, if ever. Your knowledge of the restorative arts exists solely to rob others of their lives. Take every Poison spell you can find as you'll never know when the right situation will present itself. Below are just the bread and butter options.

* **Poison Spray (Novice+):** *Deals 8 Poison damage per second. Poisoned targets take extra damage over time.*  
  A staple from the start, you can use this to triumph over others in open combat.

* **Poison Bolt (Apprentice+):** *Deals 3 Poison damage per second for 10 seconds.*  
  You'll have a hard time fighting dragons without this. And with it they're still challenging.

* **Poisonous Touch (Apprentice+):** *Deals 4.5 Poison damage per second for 10 seconds to enemies in melee range.*  
  If reverse pickpocket isn't possible you'll still be in range for this to be effective.

### Dragon Shouts

* **Bend Will:** *Targets up to level 30\40\50 are placed under your command for 10\20\30 seconds. \Dragons are forced to obey you.*  
A solid emergency button to hold onto to. You've used Illusion to control a spiraling situation before, this is just another means of doing so.

* **Marked for Death:** *Deals 5 damage, reduces enemy Magic Resistance by 25% and Armor Rating by 150 for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
If open combat is inevitable you'll need to get the most out of your magic. This is the only shout that will lower their resistance to your Poison spells.

* **Phantom Form:** *You become invisible and move silently for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
This shout has wonderful uptime, starting at 66% and hitting 100% at the second word. There's no reason not to abuse it for its stealth bonuses.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **Weakness to Poison:** *Reduces enemy Poison Resistance by 50% for 30 seconds.*
* **Poison Damage:** *Deals 4 Poison Damage per second for 10 seconds.*
* **Paralyze:** *Living targets up to level 40 have a 25% chance to be paralyzed for 10 seconds.*

 Your weapon is just a vessle for your poisons so you'll definitely want to make your stab victim more susceptible to whatever you laced it with. Extra Poison doesn't hurt (you) but it doesn't benefit from perks. Lastly, paralysis can prevent a counter attack while the Poison does its work.

#### Head

* **Fortify Illusion Cost:** *Your Illusion spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Restoration Cost:** *Your Restoration spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Armor Rating:** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 100.*

Choose a boost to the school of magic you use more often. Otherwise, you can shore up your physical defense on top of your Alteration spells.

#### Chest

* **Fortify Illusion Cost:** *Your Illusion spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Restoration Cost:** *Your Restoration spells cost 25% less.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 100.*

This is a similar decision to head. You can make the same school of magic even cheaper, balance it out, or shore up your resistance against mages.

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Pickpocket:** *You are 25% better at pickpocketing.*
* **Fortify Lockpicking:** *You are 25% better at lockpicking.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*

This seems like an obvious choice. If your chance of reverse pickpocketing is at 100% feel free to consider the other options.

#### Boots

* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*
* **Muffle:** *You move silently.*
* **Fortify Carry Weight:** *Your Carry Weight is increased by 50.*

In a stealth-focused build the first two options are golden. If you feel as though you're undetectable without the enchantments, grab the last option. The extra carry weight will give you room to stock up on poisons for the adventure ahead.

#### Necklace

* **Fortify Restoration Power:** *Your Restoration spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Fortify Illusion Power:** *Your Illusion spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*

You don't get too many chances to boost your damage output in this build so take it. Boosting Illusion instead will allow you to tackle tougher areas earlier by raising the level cap on your spells.

#### Ring

* **Fortify Restoration Power:** *Your Restoration spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Fortify Pickpocket:** *You are 25% better at pickpocketing.*
* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*

Unfortunately for you, the ring slot is capable of fortifying all of your key skills. If it's a tough decision on which one you go with, think about the method with which you kill the most enemies.

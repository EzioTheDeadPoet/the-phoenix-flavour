## Backstory

In the days of old, when Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers became Jarl of Riften, your heart was burdened with memories of the chaos that ensued. The city you once called home had turned into a place of unrest and despair. The protests erupted like wildfire, curfews gripped the streets, and whispers of hasty executions permeated the taverns. It became clear to you that the city was plagued by a sickness that couldn't be ignored. And so, with a heavy heart, you made the decision to leave.

Returning to your ancestral home in Morrowind was but a distant dream, for the land still bore the scars of its own hardships. Instead, you sought solace as a recluse, seeking refuge amidst the serene forests of the Rift. There, away from the scrutinizing eyes of the Imperials, you found freedom to worship the Daedra, both the Good and the Bad. Days were spent refining your physical prowess, while nights were dedicated to delving deep into your thoughts, reflecting on times gone by.

Within the stillness of your meditations, a single purpose emerged: to make the House of Troubles your spiritual sanctuary. Embracing the trials presented by the Bad Daedra, you believed that through their influence, true enlightenment could be attained. It was a daring path, to walk the line between their power and the allure of corruption, but you were determined to rise above it all.

Thus, your journey began. Venturing towards Windhelm, you sought passage to the distant land of Solstheim, where whispers of a shrine to the Bad Daedra could be found. However, fate had different plans in store. Just as you reached the vicinity of Darkwater Crossing, an unexpected encounter halted your progress. It was an Imperial contingent, bringing an unforeseen twist to your path.

## Summary

* **Complexity:** High
* **Race:** [Dark Elf](## "Major Skill: Destruction
Minor Skill: Conjuration, Enchanting, Illusion, One-handed, Sneak
Red Mountain’s Wisdom: Your Fire Resistance is increased by 50%, and your spells and enchantments cost 10% less.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Destruction, Hand to Hand  
  * **Defensive:** Alteration, Enchanting  
  * **Utility:** Conjuration, Sneak
* **Attributes:**  
  Resource management is crucial. Health keeps you alive on the frontline, Stamina is needed for your fists, and you need enough Magicka to cast your spells. Get what you need and don't be wasteful when using it.
  * **Health:** 5
  * **Magicka:** 2
  * **Stamina:** 3

> **Note:** For unarmed perks to work both hands need to be empty. To easily do this with hotkeys, go to the *SkyUI* MCM and toggle `Unequip Hands` for one of the groups. That group can now be used as an Unarmed hotkey.

You are not a wildfire; you are a deliberate, controlled burn. You deftly slip into position, starting fights on your own terms to give yourself the most advantage. Once the fight has broken out, turn up the heat with your Fire magic and a flurry of fists and eliminate your threats one by one. With the aid of Alteration magic you'll be formidable on the frontlines, imposing and able to withstand your opponent's counterattacks. A visit to Solstheim is a must. The island has not only the shrines for your pilgrimage but a number of spells that complement your skills. With all these tools in hand, you will make your ancestors proud.

Heavily consider taking on the beast blood as yet another challenge from the Daedra. Its *Animal* tree of perks will grant you vital Health and Stamina Regeneration that's lacking in the main build as well as unarmed damage and increased Movement Speed.

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-warrior.webp">

#### The Warrior (Guardian)

***Warborn*** *Your Health is increased by 50, and blocking is 25% more effective.*

At the end of the day Monk is a Combat build. You could opt for the *Mage* instead but you should get used to standing toe to toe with your enemies from the start. You'll be unable to block with your fists but the extra Health will go a long way.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-lord.webp">

#### The Lord

***Blood of the North:*** *Your Health Regeneration is increased by 100%, and your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%. *

One thing this build lacks is built-in healing and the Lord provides. On top of that it adds to your Magic Resistance which is always good to have. Even moreso if you're following Mehrunes Dagon as his blessing will be less painful to work with.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-tower.webp">

#### The Tower

***Warden’s Wall:*** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 100, and you reflect 100% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.*

Extra armor on the frontlines is always useful and the damage reflect aspect just adds that much more to your offense. If you choose Sheogorath as your deity this is a perfect match.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

Most Dunmer would shy away from the House of Troubles but not you. You invite the Daedra and their trials into your life, confronting them in order to reach enlightenment. **Malacath** will test your strength, **Sheogorath** your mental fortitude, and **Mehrunes Dagon** the ambition of your destructive arts. Pay little heed to Molag Bal, who asks too much and gives too little.

<details>

#### Malacath

*You have 25/50 Stamina. /  Power attacks are 50% stronger, but all other attacks are half as strong.*

If you want to lean into your Hand to Hand side, Malacath can be a strong choice. Be mindful that he doesn't tolerate half-measures. Commit to your attacks or they won't be effective. Position yourself well so that you can land power attacks without opening yourself up to extra damage.

#### Mehrunes Dagon

*Destruction spells cost 10/20% less. / You reduce the Fire, Frost, and Shock Resistance of all nearby enemies by up to 50%, but your own Fire, Frost, Shock, and Poison Resistance are reduced by 50%.*

Lowering your own resistances is daunting at first but remember you'll pick up extra resistance from your Alteration perks. The *Lord Stone* and enchantments can also help negate the downside of the Flame Tyrant. With that out of the way, he delivers a very beneficial blessing.

#### Sheogorath

*Alteration spells cost 10/20% less. / You take 50% more damage from melee weapons, but you reflect 200% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.*

If you can overcome the penalty here, Sheogorath opens up fun possibilities for the build. Combined with the *Tower Stone*, which adds armor, that's 300% melee retaliation damage. Reduce incoming damage further with *Disintegrate Weapon*, made cheaper by this blessing, and enjoy.

## Spellbook

> Full magic information can be found on the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-alteration.webp">

### Alteration

Your primary benefit here is defending yourself but this school of magic offers a multitude of treats you can partake in. Don't be shy about dabbling in its offerings, the 3 spells below barely scratch the surface of what's useful.

* **Oakflesh (Novice+):** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 40 for 120 seconds.*  
Your main source of armor throughout your adventures. With perks, this will give you stagger resistance, magic resistance, and magic absorption, making you incredibly beefy in robes.

* **Fire Shell (Adept+):** *Your Fire Resistance is increased by 50% for 120 seconds.*  
You're not using this for the extra Fire Resistance, though it's nice. You're using it to empower your unarmed strikes with *Spell Strike*. Grab that perk as soon as you hit 60 Alteration.

* **Weakness to Fire (Expert):** *You reduce enemy Fire Resistance by 50% for 60 seconds.*  
With Fire being a core damage type of the build this should come as no surprise.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-conjuration.webp">

### Conjuration

Conjuration should be viewed as a secondary spell. Its key summons are harder to acquire than others but they'll allow you to call for aid from your ancestors down the line.

* **Soul Trap (Novice+):** *If a target dies within 60 seconds, fills a soul gem.*  
A staple spell for an enchanter. Keep your soul gems filled so you can level your craft.

* **Conjure Ancestral Guardian (Adept+):** *Summons an Ancestral Guardian for 60 seconds.*  
Originally a Dunmer racial ability from earlier games, this is the perfect summon for the concept. Later versions allow you to "choose" the class of ancestor for flexibility.

* **Conjure Ash Spawn (Adept+):** *Summons an Ash Spawn for 60 seconds.*  
Ildari Sarothril may have created the horrid ash spawn but that doesn't mean you can't use them for your own purposes. Just remember to carry heart stones or you'll have a bad time.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-destruction.webp">

### Destruction

You can make use of every fire spell in the school with all the perks you have but every second casting is a second you're not punching. The *Vampiric* spells are a solid backup plan. They won't benefit from as many perks but they serve as a means of healing and bypassing resistance.

* **Firebolt (Apprentice+):** *Deals 20 Fire damage. Targets on fire take extra damage over time.*  
This is your main ranged attack option. Consider having *Vampiric Bolt* as a backup for fire-resistant enemies.

* **Flame Cloak (Adept):** *For 60 seconds, nearby enemies take 8 Fire damage per second. Targets on fire take extra damage over time.*  
A constant area of effect that complements your punches? Yes, please.

* **Vampiric Touch (Adept+):** *Absorbs 60 Health from living enemies in melee range.*  
Without Alchemy or Restoration your biggest hurdle might be healing yourself. These spells help solve that against the living at least.

## Dragon Shouts

> Full dragon shout information can be found on the [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) description page.

<details>

#### Drain Vitality<sup>DG</sup>
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*  

* **Gaan:** *Absorbs 5 Magicka per second for 30 seconds.*
* **Lah:** *Absorbs 5 Magicka and Stamina per second for 30 seconds.*
* **Haas:** *Absorbs 5 Health, Magicka, and Stamina per second for 30 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Drain Vitality absorbs twice as much Health, Magicka, and Stamina.*

An alternative to the *Vampiric* spells if you want to keep your hands empty. The meditation will double its effect, vastly improving your endurance in combat at the expense of your enemies.

#### Elemental Fury
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*

* **Su:** *Move and attack 10% faster for 30 seconds.*
* **Grah:** *Move and attack 15% faster for 30 seconds.*
* **Dun:** *Move and attack 20% faster for 30 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Elemental Fury reduces the cost of power attacking and drawing a bow by 25%.*

Increased mobility is right up the monk's alley and extra attack speed is icing on the cake. The meditation is only useful if you couldn't resist the urge to pick up a bow.

#### Fire Breath
*Cooldown: 30/45/60 seconds*

* **Yol:** *Deals 50 Fire damage. Enemies on fire take extra damage over time.*
* **Toor:** *Deals 75 Fire damage. Enemies on fire take extra damage over time.*
* **Shul:** *Deals 100 Fire damage. Enemies on fire take extra damage over time.*
* **Meditation:** *Fire Breath ignites enemies and leaves a trail of fire on the ground.*
  
This does not benefit from your Destruction perks but it's still the most suitable offensive shout you can choose from. The flame trails left by the meditation won't bother you much at all with natural resistance and Fire Shell.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Head

* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Fortify Armor Rating:** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 100.*
* **Reflect Damage:** *You reflect 50% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.*

You have the option here of making your spells cheaper but you shouldn't. Your Combat half takes precedence over your Magic half and there's a wealth of good combat options in this slot. You can't go wrong with the first two and the last is great for a retribution build.

#### Chest

* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Reflect Damage:** *You reflect 50% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.*

One of two slots you get for improving your power attacks. When you're not doing that, use it to bolster your defenses or, again, go for a retribution build.

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Unarmed:** *You deal 25% extra unarmed damage.*
* **Fortify Magicka:** *Your Magicka is increased by 50.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*

One of two slots where you can boost your unarmed damage. Take it. If that's not available, a bonus to Magicka always helps you cast better spells. If following Mehrunes Dagon, undoing his malus to one of your resistances is always an option as well.

#### Boots

* **Muffle:** *You move silently.*
* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*
* **Fortify Stamina Regeneration:** *Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*

It's easy to forget the Sneak aspect of the build but it's there and can get strong support in this slot. Muffling your footsteps will allow you to wear Heavy Armor (except chest) without penalties if you want the extra protection. The build doesn't grant any extra Stamina Regeneration on its own so you can also fit that in here if needed.

#### Necklace

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Resist Disease:** *Your Disease Resistance is increased by 100%.*

If you're not at the 75% Magic Resistance cap you should consider this to help get there. A boost to your Fire damage is always welcome. Alternatively, taking a lot of melee hits results in contracting a lot of diseases. If getting hit is part of the plan you may want some protection for those lest you spend a fortune in *Potions of Cure Disease*.

#### Ring

* **Fortify Unarmed:** *You deal 25% extra unarmed damage.*
* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*

A very contested enchantment slot for the monk. Both of your damage boosts are options here alongside all the resists. Grab what you can and play it by ear as you reach plateaus. Or carry multiple rings for multiple situations.

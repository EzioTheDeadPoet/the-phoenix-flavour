![Altmer Pilgrim](/Pictures/sss/builds/altmer-pilgrim.png)

As a devoted apprentice, you once had a special duty in the Summerset Isles: safeguarding precious artifacts and sacred shrines. When rumors of a brewing war in Skyrim reached your ears, worry gripped your heart. You knew that ancient knowledge and lore existed in faraway lands, and you feared for their safety.

To you, it seemed natural to extend your duty beyond the temple and journey into Skyrim. Though the journey was perilous, you believed you were well-prepared. Your way with words and knack for persuasion would secure the necessary funds for your mission. Moreover, your vast knowledge of Tamriel's history made you confident in your ability to navigate Skyrim's troubled politics and society.

Yet, aware of the risks, you chose to enter Skyrim secretly, bypassing the legal channels. You understood that your presence might be met with hostility, and some might mistake you for a Thalmor spy. Still, you remained steadfast in your resolve. The greater good outweighed the dangers. You were determined to protect Tamriel's precious lore at any cost.

And so, armed with your wits, you stepped into the unknown. Uncertain challenges lay ahead, but your commitment to preserving knowledge burned bright within you.

## Summary

* **Complexity:** Low
* **Race:** [High Elf](## "Major Skill: Enchanting
Minor Skills: Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Restoration
Highborn: Your Magicka is increased by 50 and your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 50%.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** One-handed, Speech
  * **Defensive:** Block, Light Armor, Restoration 
  * **Utility:** Smithing
* **Attributes:**  
  Your racial boost to Magicka goes a long way but you'll need a little bit more to keep your buffs online. One of those buffs will increase your Health, allowing you to spread more attribute points over to Stamina.
  * **Health:** 4
  * **Magicka:** 2
  * **Stamina:** 4

The Pilgrim is a stalwart fighter, standing with conviction on the front lines with a mace in one hand and a shield in the other. In that sense they play not unlike your typical sword and board character, however they utilize Restoration to imbue themselves with buffing magic and Speech to make the most from their newfound shouting abilities. Speech will also help the Pilgrim make money and, with a little bit of Smithing chops, generate some lucrative business. The Pilgrim struggles with ranged combat, typically relying on un-perked options when forced to fight at a distance. Worshippers of Auri-El can eliminate that weakness later in their adventure; others will have to find other solutions such as shouts or carrying bows.

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-warrior.webp">

#### The Warrior (Guardian)

***Warborn:*** *Your Health is increased by 50, and blocking is 25% more effective.*

Despite being a Stealth class, the Pilgrim is best served by the Warrior. A shieldbearer benefits greatly from the blocking bonus and the extra health allows you to spend your early attribute points elsewhere if necessary.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-atronach.webp">

#### The Atronach

***Sorcerer’s Oath:*** *Your Magicka is increased by 100, and you have a 25% chance to absorb the Magicka from incoming spells. However, you cannot regenerate Magicka in combat.*

The Atronach runs counter to your racial bonus but with mace and shield in hand you won't be casting much of anything in the middle of combat. Use the extra Magicka to set up buffs, then draw your weapons and strike.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-lady.webp">

#### The Lady

***Lady’s Grace:*** *Your Health, Magicka and Stamina Regeneration are increased by 50%, and by an additional 50% when you fall below half Health, Magicka, or Stamina.*

The Lady is a solid option for those who want to be versatile and switch from physical to magical more readily. This standing stone will boost your regeneration rates as they're needed, making sure you have enough Stamina and Magicka in the tank when you swap modes. If you grabbed Sun or Turn Undead spells to use against the undead, this stone is more useful.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

Being drawn to the sacred, you can easily claim to be a follower of all of the Eight when asked. But everyone has their favorites to turn to in hard times and yours are **Auri-El**, **Y'ffre**, and **Stendarr**. The former is a reflection of how you love to see yourself: as a champion of the Eight divines. The others have fueled your drive to preserve and protect throughout your life.

<details>

#### Auriel

*Your Magicka is increased by 25/50. / Your sun spells and enchantments work on the living, Daedra, and automatons.*

The chief deity of your pantheon is never a bad way to go. Extra Magicka will let you invest more into Stamina for mace swinging. A devote follower will be able to unleash powerful Sun magic on most enemies, making up for your lack of ranged options.

#### Jephre

*You gain 10/20% more experience. / You gain an additional bonus that changes based on your bard song.*

Jephre the Singer plays to the bard within you and all 3 additional bonuses are useful here. Play the flute before applying your buffs, then the drum for a defensive buff or the lute for going on the offensive. The God of Songs and Stories will help you protect the world they've grown.

#### Stendarr

*Your Health Regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / Blocking with a shield reduces incoming magic damage by 50%.*

The God of Mercy will gladly lend his steadfastness to the devout, making you more resilient on the frontlines. Health Regeneration complements spells such as Regeneration well and the secondary benefit is perfect for the shield you're already carrying.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-restoration.webp">

### Restoration

Restoration is the only school of magic truly utilized by the Pilgrim and most of it is fire-and-forget due to the fact that you'll have your hands full with your weapon and shield. Sun and Turn Undead spells are nice to have in your back pocket, especially when doing Dawnguard content, but they're not your focus.

* **Regeneration (Apprentice+):** *Restores 2 Health per second for 120 seconds.*  
  Without a hand free for active healing, you'll rely on this to provide you with substantial regeneration on the frontline.

* **Attunement (Adept+):** *Your Health is increased by 50 for 120 seconds.*  
  Essentially free Health given how long this spell lasts with your Restoration perks.

* **Circle of Strength (Adept+):** *Creates a circle on the ground that lasts for 120 seconds. Restores 10 Health per second inside the circle.*  
  Honestly any and all Circle spells are your friend here. Vitality and Strength especially allow you to stand your ground in a tough fight. 

</details>

## Dragon Shouts

> Full dragon shout information can be found on the [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) description page.

<details>

#### Dragon Aspect<sup>DB</sup>
*Cooldown: 180/240/300 seconds*  

* **Mul:** *Increases Armor Rating by 50 for 600 seconds.*
* **Qah:** *Increases Armor Rating by 100 for 600 seconds.*
* **Diiv:** *Increases Armor Rating by 100 and Magic Resistance by 25% for 600 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Dragon Aspect does not trigger a Shout cooldown.*

You're a pretty stalwart fighter and this shout makes you even moreso. The meditation will remove the shout cooldown completely, and *Epistolary Acumen* can bolster it further however you need.

#### Marked for Death
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*

* **Krii:** *Reduces enemy Health by 50 and Armor Rating by 50 for 30 seconds.*
* **Lun:** *Reduces enemy Health by 75 and Armor Rating by 100 for 30 seconds.*
* **Aus:** *Reduces enemy Health by 100 and Armor Rating by 150 for 30 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Marked for Death reduces enemy Magic Resistance by up to 25%.*
  
Your mace already strips the enemy of their armor for more damage, it only makes sense to reduce it even further.

#### Unrelenting Force
*Cooldown: 10/20/30 seconds*

* **Fus:** *Deals a 75% stagger to enemies.*
* **Ro:** *Deals a 100% stagger to enemies.*
* **Dah:** *Deals a 100% stagger and ragdolls enemies.*
* **Meditation:** *Unrelenting Force deals additional damage and breaks through wards.*

The very first shout you'll have in your arsenal and one of your best. With the *Bell Ringer* perk you'll do at least 25% extra damage to those staggered by this shout.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **Damage Armor:** *Reduces enemy Armor Rating by 150 for 30 seconds.*
* **Damage Weapon:** *Reduces enemy weapon damage by 25% for 30 seconds.*
* **Sun Damage:** *Deals 40 Sun damage to the undead. Targets on fire take extra damage over time.*

These may seem like boring selections but they get the job done. Your mace already lowers their armor so it makes sense to double down and get more out of each swing. Alternatively, you can help mitigate incoming damage, making it easily to block and recover. *Sun Damage* is a great offensive option as well, but only if you follow Auri-El.

#### Shield

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Resist Power Attack Damage:** *You resist 50% of incoming power attack damage while blocking.*
* **Fortify Health:** *Your Health is increased by 50.*

Your shield gives you an extra enchantment slot to play around with. Use it for the coveted *Resist Magic* if you can (or *Resist Spell Damage* if you're feeling confident). In the late game you'll naturally be at Block cap for regular attacks but additional boosts are necessary for incoming power attacks. *Resist Power Attack Damage* gets you most of the way there. At lower levels, *Fortify Health* may be necessary in order to hold the line.

#### Head

* **Fortify Block:** *You block 25% more damage.*
* **Fortify Restoration Cost:** *Your Restoration spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*

As you reach natural Block cap, *Fortify Block* remains useful for mitigating power attacks. *Fortify Restoration Cost* can be a lifesaver early on, allowing you to cast more spells with less Magicka investment. As you get more comfortable in the mid to late game, you can add some oomph to your power attack which land great after stripping off the enemy's armor.

#### Chest

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Restoration Cost:** *Your Restoration spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*

The Pilgrim is a character that hides behind their shield. Sometimes that shield will be hit with spells. Block can help with that but you'll want as much protection as you can get. Beyond that, this slot is much like the Head slot above. 

#### Gloves

* **Fortify One-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with One-handed weapons.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*
* **Fortify Magicka:** *Your Magicka is increased by 50.*

The obvious choice is to boost your main source of damage. If you don't have enough Magicka to dual-cast your buffs for triple duration, consider Fortify Magicka to help you bridge the gap. A third option is protecting yourself from a particular element if general magic resistance isn't effective enough for you.

#### Boots

* **Fortify Stamina Regeneration:** *Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*
* **Fortify Carry Weight:** *Your Carry Weight is increased by 50.*

None of these are must-haves so you can play around with your options. Carry Weight is always nice to have and it can help with bringing home extra loot to sell. Stamina Regeneration is probably the most useful as it will help you block and attack more readily. And more elemental resist is never a bad thing.

#### Necklace

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Block:** *You block 25% more damage.*
* **Fortify Restoration Duration:** *Your Restoration spells last 50% longer.*

*Resist Magic* and *Fortify Block* are great for those looking to reach cap and you can't go wrong putting them in this slot. *Fortify Restoration Duration* is another option if you truly want to set and forget your buffs. 

#### Ring

* **Fortify One-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with One-handed weapons.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*
* **Fortify Restoration Duration:** *Your Restoration spells last 50% longer.*

Another place to boost your main source of damage. Ideally you have 75% Magic Resistance from your other slots. If so, you can boost an elemental resistance. If not, consider *Resist Magic* here as well. If for whatever reason you don't have either enchantment, boosting your buff durations even longer is always an option.

## Backstory

In the ancient land of Valenwood, your home, you grew up following the Green Pact. This sacred code forbade the consumption of plant materials. But your insatiable curiosity questioned its wisdom. Why could you not pluck a flower for its healing properties, while traders could sell the same clipping without consequence? These inquiries branded you an oath-breaker, and you were cast out.

Yet, in your travels, you found kindred spirits. Other oath-breakers seeking the legendary Cradle of Ilmyris crossed your path. You joined them, learning survival skills and exploring the untamed wilderness. However, your thirst for knowledge led you down morally ambiguous paths, and you were once again banished.

Feeling rejected and alone, you turned your gaze to Skyrim, a land free from the restrictions that bound you in Valenwood. Whispers reached your ears of potent magical relics hidden within the northern ruins. This presented an opportunity to acquire the knowledge and power you craved. With nothing to lose, you embarked on a journey to cross the border and begin a new chapter in your quest for understanding.

## Summary

* **Complexity:** Moderate
* **Race:** [Wood Elf](## "Major Skill: Archery 
	Minor Skills: Hand to Hand, Light Armor, One-handed, Pickpocket, Security
	Green Pact: Your Movement Speed is increased by 10%, and you take 50% less damage from falling. You deal 25% extra damage with sneak attacks and spells.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Destruction  
  * **Defensive:** Alteration
  * **Utility:** Alchemy, Enchanting, Sneak
* **Attributes:**  
You're a mage with very little need for Magicka. Your points are best spent bolstering your endurance.
  * **Health:** 2
  * **Magicka:** 0
  * **Stamina:** 3

The Bosmer Mage starts their journey as one would expect: wearing robes and flinging spells with both hands. But instead of investing in Magicka and spell cost reduction perks, they opt to pour their efforts into Enchanting, using scrolls and staves to do their casting for them. This allows the Bosmer to stay nimble and out of harm's way while still being a devastating master of Destruction.

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-mage.webp">

#### The Mage (Guardian)

***Path of Wisdom:*** *Your Magicka is increased by 50, and your spells and enchantments cost 10% less.*

You won't have much to your name starting out so you'll have to do things the old fashioned way. This will give you enough Magicka to get going without having to invest in it.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-atronach.webp">

#### The Atronach

***Sorcerer’s Oath:*** *Your Magicka is increased by 100, and you have a 25% chance to absorb the Magicka from incoming spells. However, you cannot regenerate Magicka in combat.*

Another 100 Magicka won't mean too much to you but 25% Spell Absorption is a fantastic defensive boon. When stacked with high Magic Resistance and *Spell Sip*, enemy casters will be nothing more than flies.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-serpent.webp">

#### The Serpent

***Serpent’s Kiss:*** *Your Poison Resistance is increased by 50%, your potions last 50% longer, and your poisons last for two additional hits.*

Extra Poison Resistance isn't nothing but it's not what you're here for. A 50% duration boost on your already potent potions will save you plenty of vials in the long run.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

The Bosmer are Y'ffre's people but you've long since turned your back on him and his Pact. It was the call of **Herma-Mora** that put you on your current quest for forbidden knowledge, and the promises of **Clavicus Vile** that keep you walking it. As your mind opened to new possibilities, you heard of the Natural Order and **Peryite**. All three promise rewards but you're not fool enough to worship any of them to the degree they ask of you.

<details>

#### Clavicus Vile

*Buying and selling prices are 10% better.*

Clavicus Vile sings promises of wealth and status and can help you navigate the markets of Skyrim better than what your upbringing prepared you for. If you're on the hunt to purchase powerful staves, let this Daedric Prince help with the negotiations. 

#### Hermaeus Mora

*You have a 5% chance to absorb the Magicka from incoming spells.*

Herma-Mora gives little for your half-hearted devotion but the Spell Absorption can add up nicely with other sources. If you're looking to manipulate your luck on the battlefield, you'll need the Lord of Fate and Knowledge on your side.

#### Peryite

*Your potions last 25% longer.*

Peryite may be one of the weakest of the Princes but he still knows enough about the Green to help you squeeze that much more from your potions.

## Spellbook

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-alteration.webp">

### Alteration

Enchanted staves have limited support for this school of magic but scrolls are around to save the day. You'll want to carry a handful of useful buffs in scroll form as their durations will be supercharged by your perks. In the early game, use your Magicka to cast Novice and Apprentice level spells.

* **Scroll of Oakflesh (Novice+):** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 40 for 120 seconds.*  
  Armor spell staves aren't available so you'll need to rely on scrolls for your protection needs. With all of your perks these should last quite a long time and are definitely worth the trouble.

* **Scroll of Feather (Apprentice+):** *Your Carry Weight is increased by 50 for 120 seconds.*  
  Keep a few of these handy just in case you find yourself overburdened on the road. The stamina drain from carrying too much is simply not something you can tolerate.

* **Scroll of Weight of the World (Master):** *Reduces enemy Movement Speed and Attack Speed in a large area by 50% for 60 seconds.* 
  With an unfurling of this scroll you can bring a room of enemies to a crawl, and that's before your frost magic has had its way with them. It's one worth carrying around in your back pocket, so to speak.
  

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-destruction.webp">

### Destruction

As an elementalist you have the option of choosing fire, frost, or shock magic in any situation. You'll also have Vampiric options should you want to drain Health from your victims instead. Instead of listing 3 recommended spells, here are three go-to spell types:

* **Missile (Apprentice+):** *Firebolt / Ice Spike / Lightning Bolt*  
  These are single target bursts of respectable damage at range. You'll be using these often to pick off targets from afar while undetected. Carry one staff of every element for these as it's your bread and butter.

* **Area Missile (Adept+):** *Fireball / Ice Storm / Chain Lightning*
  The area spells behave a little differently from each other but they're useful for clearing out a mob should you be fortunate enough to find one clumped together. *Fireball* is a solid go-to in this category as successive casts will benefit from *Firebrand*.

* **Wall (Expert):** *Wall of Flames / Wall of Frost / Wall of Storms*  
  A late addition to your toolkit but a good one. *Wall of Frost* is especially useful as it will also slow anyone who walks through the wall approaching you, giving you an opportunity to widen the distance. 

</details>

## Dragon Shouts

> Full dragon shout information can be found on the [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) description page.

<details>

#### Animal Ally
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*  

* **Raan:** *Summons a wolf for 60 seconds.*
* **Mir:** *Summons a sabre cat for 60 seconds.*
* **Tah:** *Summons a bear for 60 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Your Animal Ally's Armor Rating is increased by 150, and their Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*

 A facsimile of the vanilla *Command Animal* power Bosmer had that's useful for keeping some distance between you and your enemies in a fight.

#### Dismay
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*

* **Faas:** *Living targets up to level 20 flee combat for 30 seconds.*
* **Ru:** *Living targets up to level 30 flee combat for 30 seconds.*
* **Maar:** *Living targets up to level 40 flee combat for 30 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Dismay works on the undead, Daedra, and Dwarven automatons.*
  
Sometimes raining down chaos alone doesn't instill the panic you were hoping for. Use this to encourage your victims into the right mindset.

#### Soul Tear<sup>DG</sup>
*Cooldown: 120/150/180 seconds*

* **Rii:** *Deals 5 Magic damage per second for 10 seconds.*
* **Vaaz:** *Deals 7.5 Magic damage per second for 10 seconds. If the target dies, fills a soul gem.*
* **Zol:** *Deals 10 Magic damage per second for 10 seconds. If the target dies, fills a soul gem and reanimates their corpse.*
* **Meditation:** *Soul Tear deals extra damage over 10 seconds.*

This fills a void left by your perk selection. Damage combined with a Soul Trap effect allows you to fill your gems without swapping staves. With the final word you can turn your victims into allies which is also thematic for a vampire.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **None:** *This build does not use physical weaponry.*

#### Head

* **Fortify Potion Duration:** *Your potions last 50% longer.*
* **Fortify Stamina Regeneration:** *Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Cost:** *Your Destruction spells cost 25% less.*

You can make your potions last even longer with this slot, which is always beneficial. Stamina Regeneration is vital for sneaking around at length. Cheaper spells are more useful to a mage who uses their own Magicka, but if you're finding that your staves are running out of juice too quickly you should consider the third option here.

#### Chest

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Cost:** *Your Destruction spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Shout Duration:** *Your Shouts last 50% longer.*

If you aren't at 75% Magic Resistance this is a great slot for getting caught up. Otherwise you can make your damage staves last even longer or give a rare boost to your shouts (as the three recommended would all benefit).

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Sneak Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*
* **Fortify Potion Duration:** *Your potions last 50% longer.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*

Sneak Spell Attacks make up the bulk of your damage when things go well so make sure to boost it here while you can. More Potion Duration is also great too. If you don't have access to those you can round off your elemental Resistance.

#### Boots

* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*
* **Muffle:** *You make 50% less noise while moving.*
* **Fortify Movement Speed:** *Your Movement Speed is increased by 20%.*

Sneaking is something you do often so it's only natural for your footwear choices to revolve around it. The sneakier you are, the more havok you can wreak without anyone counterattacking. It's a win/win.

#### Necklace

* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Alteration Duration:** *Your Alteration spells last 50% longer.*

Necklace has plenty for you to enjoy. As mostly all of your damage is from Destruction magic, boosting that is your #1 priority. After that you have the luxury to experiment with other choices, though Alteration Duration will make your scrolls last even longer.

#### Ring

* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Fortify Sneak Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*
* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*

This slot is even more competitive than the necklace. Again, a boost to your bread and butter can not be ignored, but there's another damage boost to be had. If you can't take advantage of those two, remaining hidden is a high priority.

## Backstory

The first time you showed an interest in magic, the Chief laughed. It was the boisterous, rumbling laugh of a grizzled and seasoned warrior. "Why would you trust a spell over a fine blade made of orichalcum?" he mused. "They must have gotten more mer blood than the rest of us," his forgewife jested over the sound of her hammering. Magic was an afterthought in the stronghold unless you were a wise woman, and you most certainly were not. So when the time came, you thanked your elders for their lessons in blacksmithing and in combat and chose to leave the stronghold like many orcs before you. The traditional life simply was not for you. Perhaps you'll find a place elsewhere.
 

What you found was underwhelming. Settlements welcomed you with open arms, but the veneer of friendliness would disappear quickly once they realized you were not a skilled blacksmith like they'd heard. With nothing to offer their armories, the other races kept their distance, leaving you on your own until you packed up and moved to the next village only to repeat the process. But along the way you heard rumors, and one of which spoke of an Orc at the College of Winterhold. An Orc that wouldn't belittle you for your interest in the arcane. Perhaps, if you could just make your way into the cold north of Skyrim, you can find a place that you could call home.

## Summary

* **Complexity:** High
* **Race:** [Orc](## "Major Skill: Heavy Armor
Minor Skills: Block, Enchanting, One-handed, Smithing, Two-handed 
Orsinium's Heir: Your Health is increased by 50 and your Health Regeneration is increased by 50%.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Archery, Conjuration, One-handed  
  * **Defensive:** Alteration, Illusion  
  * **Utility:** Sneak
* **Attributes:**  
Almost everything you do will require Magicka but you can't ignore your other attributes just in case things go awry.
  * **Health:** 2
  * **Magicka:** 5
  * **Stamina:** 3

When everything goes according to plan you expect little to no resistance. Enemies won't hear you approaching. They won't hear you summon your weapon. They won't hear you strip their armor with magic. And if you strike true they won't hear the attack that kills them. When things don't go as planned, you'll still have a toolbox of spells to help get things back on the rails. Illusion and Alteration spells are your keys in taking control of a situation, getting back to a point where you can slip back into the shadows and resume your quiet and subtle work. Whether in close quarters or at range, you'll be able to take your targets out with lethal efficiency.

## Perks

### Early Game: Curious Caster

An orsimer needs to work twice as hard to be half the mage an altmer would be and that effort starts here. Lay down the foundations of your magical toolkit now and start putting it to work. It won't be the most effective but you'll reap the rewards down the line.

<details>

</details>

Things should reach their natural zeniths after intense studying. Being detected should not be a concern of yours at this point, but even when you're out in the open you can still be formidable... or you can reset and try again.

<details>

* **Balance 2 (60):** Alteration spells last 100% longer.

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-mage.webp">

#### The Mage (Guardian)

***Path of Wisdom:*** *Your Magicka is increased by 50, and your spells and enchantments cost 10% less.*

You'll want a large Magicka pool and this provides one early in the game. It doesn't help your martial side at all but it's the best option of the three stones.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-apprentice.webp">

#### The Apprentice

***Elfborn:*** *Your Magicka regenerates twice as fast, but your Magic Resistance is reduced by 25%.*

Aptly named for this build, this stone leans into the glass cannon concept. Your Magicka pool will greatly benefit from this blessing however you may find yourself promptly cooked by opposing mages if they discover you.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-shadow.webp">

#### The Shadow

***Moonshadow:*** *You are 25% harder to detect while sneaking, and you deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*

Sneaking, sneak attacks, and sneak spells are pretty much your modus operandi in full. This stone benefits everything you aim to do which makes it a safe mid-to-late-game option.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

A life of following **Malacath** has only led to you feeling more spurned and ostracized than ever. Your curiosity in magic has led your towards entities such as **Julianos** the wise and the "Apprentice's God," **Syrabane**.

<details>

#### Julianos

*Your Magicka is increased by 25.*

This is a solid benefit for anyone dipping their toes in the religion of the Empire. Especially early on when 25 Magicka is a solid chunk of your total.

#### Malacath

*Your Stamina is increased by 25.*

You could never turn your back on Malacath. The extra Stamina he grants can be put to use with your bow or running to safety when discovered.

#### Syrabane

*Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 25%.*

The Warlock's God is also a suitable choice for a young arcanist. If you feel your Magicka pool is large enough, feel free to switch to this blessing from *Julianos.*

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-alteration.webp">

### Alteration

Use the school of alteration to bolster your own defenses just in case. Also use it to scout ahead and to make your enemies vulnerable. Alteration is a powerful toolbox in the right hands and your hands look plenty capable.

* **Oakflesh (Novice+):** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 40 for 120 seconds.*  
  With your perks you can get fairly respectable armor ratings from these spells. They will save your life from a stray hit if you're ever detected.

* **Detect Life (Apprentice+):** *You can see nearby living targets through walls.*  
  You should know where your enemy is if you intend to hide from them.

* **Corrode Armor (Adept+):** *Reduces enemy Armor Rating by 150 for 60 seconds.*  
  Stripping the enemy of their defenses before stabbing them in the back is just good form.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-conjuration.webp">

### Conjuration

The combination of your smithing training in the stronghold and your curiosity with magic has led you to conjured weapons. With your perks these weapons will be viable throughout the game and keep your status bars topped off.

* **Bound Dagger (Novice):** *Summons a Bound Dagger for 120 seconds.*  
  This will be your go-to melee weapon later in the game when you have ranks of *Assassin's Blade*.

* **Bound Sword (Apprentice):** *Summons a Bound Sword for 120 seconds.*  
  This benefits from every One-handed and Sneak perk as daggers with the exception of *Assassin's Blade*. Meaning you're more than welcome to use it until the late game.

* **Bound Bow (Adept):** *Summons a Bound Bow for 120 seconds.*  
  It's a bit of a climb to get to this one but you'll want to be able to use it ASAP. Don't be afraid to spend money on Archery training before you get here.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-illusion.webp">

### Illusion

You've found that dabbling in Illusion can make others temporarily forget about your slights, giving you the chance to reposition for better advantages. 

* **Calm (Novice+):** *Living targets up to level 5 won’t fight for 30 seconds.*  
  A good way to put some distance between an aggressive enemy and yourself. Once you have *Serenity* you can abuse the effect to land an extra sneak attack without breaking the spell.

* **Silence (Apprentice+):** *Living targets up to level 10 won’t cast spells for 30 seconds.*  
  Most of the time your enemy will be too surprised to cast but when it's unavoidable you'll want to  make sure they can't. With *Tranquility* you can use this to strip off magical protections.

* **Muffle (Adept+):** *You move silently for 30 seconds.*  
  This line of spells gets more and more reliable with every tier. Use it for that extra boost you need to stay hidden.

### Dragon Shouts

* **Aura Whisper:** *Nearby living targets can be seen through walls for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
Unlike the higher level Alteration spells of similar purpose, this can only find the living. Another difference is that it distinguishes between friend and foe which is situationally useful.

* **Marked for Death:** *Deals 5 damage, reduces enemy Magic Resistance by 25% and Armor Rating by 150 for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
If you can mark them without being discovered, the debuffs to their defenses will make enemies even more susceptible to your sneak attacks.

* **Phantom Form:** *You become invisible and move silently for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
Shorter cooldown than *Become Ethereal* with as long a duration. It doesn't make you immune to taking damage but if no one knows where you are you shouldn't be taking much of it. At the 2nd and 3rd word this has an 100% uptime you should definitely take advantage of.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **None:** *(This build does not use physical weaponry.)*

#### Head

* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*
* **Fortify Illusion Cost:** *Your Illusion spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Conjuration Cost** *Your Conjuration spells cost 25% less.*

If you have your *Bound Bow* ready, boosting your ranged damage is a terrific option. You can also benefit from reducing your spell costs if either school is draining your Magicka pool too fast.

#### Chest

* **Fortify Illusion Cost:** *Your Illusion spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Conjuration Cost** *Your Conjuration spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Alteration Cost:** *Your Alteration spells cost 25% less.*

Boosting your resistance is usually a safe option here. Usually. You don't plan on taking any direct fire from the shadows, however, so lower your spell costs even more so casting is that much more manageable.

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Sneak Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*
* **Fortify One-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with One-handed weapons.*
* **Fortify Magicka:** *Your Magicka is increased by 50.*

Damage boosts your go-to here. Alternatively, an increase to Magicka might give you the ability to cast a new, powerful spell. *Fortify Magicka Regeneration* is an alternative if your Magicka pool is large but in that case just go with the damage.

#### Boots

* **Muffle:** *You move silently.*
* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*
* **Fortify Stamina:** *Your Stamina is increased by 50.*

When combined with invisibility, *Muffle* makes you completely undetectable, making it an essential enchantment for a stealth build. If you don't have access to it, being stealthier is an alternative. And lastly, simply having more Stamina to work with is better than most other options.

#### Necklace

* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*
* **Fortify Illusion Power:** *Your Illusion spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Fortify Alteration Power:** *Your Alteration spells last 50% longer.*

Again, if you have your *Bound Bow* you'll want to support it. Otherwise, the boost to Illusion will help you handle stronger enemies earlier. If you like to make use of Alteration's utility spells, a 50% duration boost can make them more set-and-forget.

#### Ring

* **Fortify Sneak Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*
* **Fortify Sneak:** *You are 25% better at sneaking.*
* **Fortify Illusion Power:** *Your Illusion spells are 25% stronger.*

Take the boost to your bread and butter attack. If that's unavailable, become more stealthy to get more of those bread and butter attacks. And if that is also unavailable, *Calm* your way into free sneak attacks.

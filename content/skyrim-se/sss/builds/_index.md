Below are a list of character builds I've personally created and use in the list. They aren't necessarily the most *optimized* builds, but they are *viable* and *varied* so I still get to have a satisfying amount of role-play. Please use them for inspiration or guidance in creating your own characters.

In each build you'll find perk builds and recommendations (typically 3) for standing stones, deity worship, and enchantment choices. I've also included shortlists of key spells and shouts for each build. I have omitted specific equipment recommendations and alchemical combinations for now. Those may come in future updates.

> **Note:** While these are named after classes from earlier Elder Scrolls games, the names were just a starting concept. The end result tends to be slightly different as I try to incorporate Combat, Magic, and Stealth elements into every build for versatility.

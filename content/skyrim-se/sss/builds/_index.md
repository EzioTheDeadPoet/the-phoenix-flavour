Below are a list of character builds I've personally created and use in the list. They aren't necessarily the most *optimized* builds, but they are *viable* and I still get to have a satisfying amount of role-play. Please use them for inspiration or guidance in creating your own characters.

In each build you'll find a list of 55 perks (the hard limit in SSS) and recommendations for standing stones, deity worship, and enchantment choices. I've also included a spellbook of key spells and shouts for each build. I have omitted specific equipment recommendations and alchemical combinations for now. Those may come in future updates.

> **Note:** While these are named after classes from earlier Elder Scrolls games, that was just a starting concept. The end result tends to be slightly different as I try to incorporate Combat, Magic, and Stealth elements into every build for versatility.

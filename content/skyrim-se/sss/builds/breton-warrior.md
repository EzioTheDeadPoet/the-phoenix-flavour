![Breton Warrior](/Pictures/sss/builds/breton-warrior.png)

In the city of Evermore, you were born into a noble family, carrying the weight of certain expectations. Being the third child, one of these expectations was to bring honor to your family by serving in a knightly order. Your education was a whirlwind of lessons, ranging from studying the history of Tamriel to learning archery, finances, swordsmanship, and even the magical arts.

But becoming a knight didn't happen as you hoped. The years passed, and the orders overlooked you. They believed you needed to improve your skills before seeking membership again. To you, that meant finding a real battlefield to test yourself, rather than the staged skirmishes at the provincial borders.

Rumors of a growing civil war caught your attention. Skyrim seemed like a place where a suitable battlefield could be found. However, your parents wouldn't approve of your journey, denying you the official passage befitting your status. Undeterred, you set off alone and crossed the border unlawfully.

Soon enough, you stumbled upon a battlefield, or rather, it found you. You unwittingly came across an Imperial ambush intended for the Stormcloaks. Fearing you might reveal their location, the Imperials overwhelmed and captured you, planning to deal with you after the rebels.

Bound and uncertain of your escape, you made a vow to yourself: never to be defeated again.

## Summary

* **Complexity:** Low
* **Race:** [Breton](## "Major Skill: Conjuration
Minor Skills: Alchemy, Alteration, Illusion, Restoration, Speech
Spell Warding: Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%, and you have a 15% chance to absorb the Magicka from incoming spells.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Two-Handed, Archery
  * **Defensive:** Alteration, Block, Heavy Armor
  * **Utility:** Smithing
* **Attributes:**  
  You'll have high defenses but you'll still need enough base Health to take the hits to begin with. After that, Stamina allows you to swing your greatsword and cleave your enemies. Lastly, make sure you have enough Magicka to cast a few Alteration buffs for the situation.
  * **Health:** 3
  * **Magicka:** 1
  * **Stamina:** 2

The Breton Warrior is a juggernaut. Clad in heavy armor with an extra layer of Alteration magic alongside the innate protection of a Breton, it's nigh impossible to attain higher defenses. Once secured, you're free to cut your enemies down one by one, or in groups with cleaving power attacks. When your targets are out of reach, take out your crossbolt and pelt them with bolts until they're no longer a threat.

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-warrior.webp">

#### The Warrior (Guardian)

***Warborn:*** *Your Health is increased by 50, and blocking and bashing are 25% more effective.*

What's there not to like? Your guardian stone gives you plenty of Health and makes two options you can perform with your greatsword better.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-lord.webp">

#### The Lord

***Blood of the North:*** *Your Health Regeneration is increased by 100%, and your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*

Health Regeneration is your main source of healing, and the boost to Magic Resistance means you need one less source of it to reach the cap. With this, your racial bonuses, and *Spell Shield*, for instance, you'd be at 75% without needing enchanting.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-steed.webp">

#### The Steed

***Charioteer:*** *You move 20% faster and your Carry Weight is increased by 100.*

If you feel secure in your defenses, a 20% Movement Speed boost and a Carry Weight increase can provide plenty of utility. A great choice for the late game where you'll likely be indestructible from other sources.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

[desc]

<details>

Though you did not make it into one of the templar knightly orders, you were raised to learn and worship the gods. This includes the Eight Divines such as **Arkay** and **Stendarr** that are widely worshiped in Breton culture, but also the elven gods of your ancestors such as **Magnus**.

#### Arkay

*Your Health is increased by 25.*

A warrior lives on the edge between life and death and, as such, they are intimately familiar with Arkay and his teachings. If you honor him, he will grant you extra life so that you can serve up more death to your enemies. A fair trade.

#### Magnus

*You have 5% Spell Absorption.*

Leaning into your elven heritage with Magnus makes you more in tune with sorcery, allowing you to absorb your enemies' spells more frequently. As you're likely to hit Armor Rating and Magic Resistance caps from other avenues, this bonus can be attractive in the late game.

#### Stendarr

*Your Health Regeneration is increased by 25.*

Knowing when to swing and when to stow your blade is essential for a proper warrior and following Stendarr shows a dedication towards justice. In return, the Steadfast God will help you stay on your feet longer with Health Regeneration.

## Spellbook

> Full magic information can be found on the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-alteration.webp">

### Alteration

Bretons start with spells from 3 schools of magic, but you'll mostly use *Oakflesh* and Alteration for the entirety of your adventure. The others will help you get things rolling but in the long term you'll want to save your Magicka for what makes you tankier.

* **Oakflesh (Novice+):** *Your Armor Rating is increased by 80 for 120 seconds.*  
  The Armor Rating is always appreciated but as you get stronger you're mainly interested in the Magic and stagger resistance perks will add to these spells.

* **[Element] Shell (Adept+):** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50% for 120 seconds.*  
  If you have an idea of what's coming in your direction, use this to shore up your defenses and close the distance. The Master versions will bring your resistance to the cap on their own, freeing your enchantment slots.

* **Equilibrium (Adept+):** *Sacrifices Health to restore a moderate amount of Magicka and Stamina.*  
  With your defenses, Health pool, and Natural Health regeneration, sometimes it will be prudent to drain your health in order to cast another spell or make more power attacks. Use your judgment, but you can take it.

</details>

## Dragon Shouts

> Full dragon shout information can be found on the [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) description page.

<details>

#### Dragon Aspect<sup>DB</sup>
*Cooldown: 180/240/300 seconds*  

* **Mul:** *Increases Armor Rating by 50 for 600 seconds.*
* **Qah:** *Increases Armor Rating by 100 for 600 seconds.*
* **Diiv:** *Increases Armor Rating by 100 and Magic Resistance by 25% for 600 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Dragon Aspect does not trigger a Shout cooldown.*

The perfect defensive shout for a defensive warrior. Extra Armor Rating in its first two words and then a lovely amount of Magic Resistance with its final word. Add the meditation and it becomes completely free to use. The only downside is how hard it is to obtain.

#### Lightning Breath
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*

* **Strun:** *Deals 50 Shock damage to Health and Magicka.*
* **Gaar:** *Deals 75 Shock damage to Health and Magicka.*
* **Kest:** *Deals 100 Shock damage to Health and Magicka.*
* **Meditation:** *Lightning Breath deals extra Magicka damage over 30 seconds.*

The warrior lacks ranged options, making them especially vulnerable to enemies who cast spells at a distance. Lightning Breath works to drain them of Magicka to use for that, especially so with the meditation.

#### Subdue
*Cooldown: 60/90/120 seconds*  

* **Zun:** *Reduces enemy weapon damage by 25% for 20 seconds.*
* **Haal:** *Reduces enemy weapon damage by 25% for 40 seconds.*
* **Viik:** *Reduces enemy weapon damage by 25% for 60 seconds.*
* **Meditation:** *Subdue reduces enemy weapon damage by an additional 25%.*

You're already quite sturdy but robbing your opponents of their weapon damage makes you that much more durable. Consider this your bread and butter shout to use in boss rooms to make sure you aren't overpowered.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon (Melee)

* **Damage Weapon:** *Reduces enemy weapon damage by 25% for 30 seconds.*
* **Damage Armor:** *Reduces enemy Armor Rating by 150 for 30 seconds.*
* **Absorb Stamina:** *Absorbs 30 Stamina.*

The top recommendation loses oomph as you become tankier but it's never a bad option. *Damage Armor* will improve your damage on every subsequent swing, and *Absorb Stamina* will let you dish out more power attacks while robbing them of being able to use their own.

#### Weapon (Ranged)

* **Silence:** *Living targets up to level 40 have a 25% chance to be silenced for 30 seconds.*
* **Damage Armor:** *Reduces enemy Armor Rating by 150 for 30 seconds.*
* **Chaos Damage:** *Has a 50% chance to deal 30 Fire, Frost, or Shock Damage.*

Your crossbow is a lot more versatile. Many ranged foes will be spellcasters and a 25% chance at shutting them down is a die worth rolling. Alternatively you can go for the same armor malus as above. For fun, *Chaos Damage* is another die roll to spice things up. 

#### Head

* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Fortify Block:** *You block 25% more damage.*
* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*

Power attacks make up a large percentage of your swings, especially once you gain the *Cleave* perk. If you can't get a hold of that, blocking more or dealing more ranged damage with your crossbow are solid options for this slot.

#### Chest

* **Fortify Power Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with power attacks.*
* **Fortify Alteration Cost:** *Your Alteration spells cost 25% less.*
* **Resist Stagger:** *You resist 25% of incoming stagger and take 25% less damage while staggered.*

Your defenses from other sources are so good you don't need to spend this slot on boosting them. Instead, grab more damage with power attacks or make your armor spells a little cheaper. If you don't have both stagger perks, *Resist Stagger* can be useful for staying on the offensive.

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Two-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with Two-handed weapons.*
* **Fortify Magicka:** *Your Magicka is increased by 50.*
* **Fortify Magicka Regeneration:** *Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 50%.*

*Fortify Two-handed* is a no brainer. Raising Elemental Resistance is another option here but you can cover that with Alteration's shell spells. So instead of those enchantments boost your Magicka and Regeneration, allowing you to invest more into Stamina.

#### Boots

* **Fortify Movement Speed:** *Your Movement Speed is increased by 20%.*
* **Fortify Stamina Regeneration:** *Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*
* **Fortify Stamina:** *Your Stamina is increased by 50.*

The pickings are slim for the warrior here. Movement Speed isn't a priority but useful enough to be the top choice. Stamina and Regeneration allow you to power attack, block, and bash more, so those are the two next best options as you can never have enough.

#### Necklace

* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*
* **Fortify Alteration Duration:** *Your Alteration spells last 50% longer.*
* **Resist Stagger:** *You resist 25% of incoming stagger and take 25% less damage while staggered.*

The boost to ranged damage is occasionally useful but enough to warrant the top spot. *Fortify Alteration Duration* is a convenience choice as your Alteration spells last a good while already. And, if you're still getting staggered, you can help mitigate that here.

#### Ring

* **Fortify Two-handed:** *You deal 25% extra damage with Two-handed weapons.*
* **Resist Disease:** *Your Disease Resistance is increased by 100%.*
* **Fortify Alteration Duration:** *Your Alteration spells last 50% longer.*

A boost to your main damage source is always worth taking. Standing toe to toe with enemies is a great way of contracting diseases. If you don't have resistance from another source, consider this enchantment or a lot of *Potions of Cure Disease* are in your future.

## Backstory

Your family can be traced back to the days of Uriel Septim VI where, in Winterhold, they served Ulfe Gersen with honor and rose into prominence. They were not afraid of magic back then. Your ancestors used spells as a Nord would a steel axe now. That aversion came many centuries later when the Great Collapse drove your family from the place they called home and thrust them into hardship throughout the empire. Your parents never speak of these events, but the handful of possessions they managed to hold onto were enough to spark your curiosity in what used to be.


When you came of age, you pulled up stakes and left everyone and everything you knew. You longed to connect to the past and doing so meant disconnecting from the present and returning to Skyrim and Winterhold. But doing so is easier said than done as war looms on the horizon. Skyrim will need its sons and daughters to fight for her as well. That was clear as ice when the Imperials shoved you into their prison carriage at the border crossing...


## Summary

* **Complexity:** Low
* **Race:** [Nord](## "Major Skill: Two-handed
Minor Skills: Block, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Smithing, Speech
Nordic Heritage: Your Frost Resistance is increased by 50%, and you take 25% less damage while power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell.")
* **Skills:**
  * **Offensive:** Archery, Conjuration, Destruction
  * **Defensive:** Alchemy, Light Armor
  * **Utility:** Enchanting
* **Attributes:**  
Stamina will be vital in consistently firing your bow and sprinting to safer locations if the enemy gets close. Also, the boost in Magicka from the Atronach Stone allows you to focus your points elsewhere.
  * **Health:** 3 (30%)
  * **Magicka:** 2 (25%)
  * **Stamina:** 4 (45%)

Think of yourself as the quintessential ranger, except instead of having a tamed beast at your side you'll employ the assistance of summoned daedra, most notably the Frost Atronach. These burly minions will whittle down your opponent's stamina and speed as well as their health, soak up attacks, and ultimately make it harder for melee combatants to reach you. Meanwhile, you'll stay safe and incredibly deadly on the back line, putting an enchanted bow to maximum effect. Destruction spells can be useful as well, but keep in mind that Magicka won't regenerate in combat. Always keep enough in the tank for another summon.

## Perks

## Standing Stones

> Full standing stone information can be found on the [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) description page.

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-thief.webp">

#### The Thief (Guardian)

***Cheater’s Luck:*** *Your Stamina is increased by 50, you move 10% faster, and you take 50% less damage from falling.*

Drawing a bow can be draining on stamina and the extra move speed can help distance you from an opponent. This is a great stone to start with as it'll keep you alive until other options are available.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-atronach.webp">

#### The Atronach

***Sorcerer’s Oath:*** *Your Magicka is increased by 100, and you have a 25% chance to absorb the Magicka from incoming spells. However, you cannot regenerate Magicka in combat.*

Ideally you'll be summoning your frost atronach and setting runes out of combat, making the Magicka regeneration penalty less harsh. The extra Magicka allows you to focus your attribute points elsewhere, such as more stamina for shooting.

<img align="right" width="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/the-ritual.webp">

#### The Ritual

***Mother’s Sorrow:*** *You can summon or reanimate one additional minion, but your summoning and reanimation spells last half as long.*

In the late game your summoning durations will be obnoxiously long. Cutting them in half for the benefit of having a 2nd or 3rd atronach is a powerful trade worth considering.

</details>

## Faith

> Full religion information can be found on the [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) description page.

Wherever you come from originally you recognize the Nine Divines of the Imperial Pantheon. Few families are so rooted in the Empire as yours, after all. Of the Nine, three in particular speak to you in your journeys. **Kynareth** is often the patron of travelers like yourself. It was **Julianos** who urged you to leave your home in search of history's forgotten lessons. And you can never forget the ubiquitous **Akatosh**, god-defender of the Empire who commands you to worship the Nine.

<details>

#### Akatosh

*You gain 10% more experience.*

You can never go wrong with the chief deity as he'll provide you with a solid experience boost. Faster leveling means faster access to powerful perks that will keep your adventures moving smoothly.

#### Julianos

*Your Magicka is increased by 25.*

Alternatively, a boost to your Magicka may be the difference needed to cast a higher tier spell. This option is especially suitable when leaning into life at the College of Winterhold as you'll be more in touch with your magical studies there.

#### Kynareth

*Your Stamina is increased by 25.*

Extra stamina is always useful and the shrine can be found early on in Whiterun. You can't go wrong with this choice. At some point you may feel that your Stamina Regeneration makes the extra Stamina less useful. If that happens, consider switching to another deity.

## Spellbook

<details>

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-conjuration.webp">

### Conjuration

Every ranger needs a companion and Conjuration provides. The summon is the star of the show, no two ways about it. The only question is how do you plan on advancing your skill to the point of binding on to this plane?

* **Soul Trap (Novice+):** *If a target dies within 60 seconds, fills a soul gem.*  
  You'll need soul gems for enchanting and you'll also need to level Conjuration a fair bit for your other key spells. This will help you towards both ends.

* **Bound Bow (Adept):** *Summons a Bound Bow for 120 seconds.*  
  In another universe this build would take all of the bound weaponry perks. In this universe, this is a early-to-mid-game option to help conserve arrows and level Conjuration.

* **Conjure Frost Atronach (Adept+):** *Summons a Frost Atronach for 60 seconds.*  
  Your best friend. It's large, tanky, and slows your opponents with its aura. Shooting around it can be a pain but you'll be glad it's there.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/Pictures/sss/builds/skill-destruction.webp">

### Destruction

Destruction is a strong backup plan to your bow and you could easily learn and utilize the entire portfolio of Frost spells here. The spells below synergize best with the build and concept, however.

* **Frostbite (Novice+):** *Deals 8 Frost damage per second to Health and Stamina.*  
  A staple Destruction spell that will help you get through the early game. Use this every once in awhile to save on arrows.

* **Frost Rune (Apprentice+):** *Creates a rune on the ground that explodes when enemies approach, dealing 40 Frost damage to Health and Stamina.*  
  Placing these ahead of you before a fight can save your life. In addition to the damage it will apply an additional slow to the enemy, giving you extra time to finish them off.

* **Ice Storm (Adept+):** *Deals 40 Frost damage to Health and Stamina in a large area.*  
  Due to your atronach's resistance you can freely cast this in an area centered around them, dealing damage to anything unfortunate enough to be caught in the radius.

### Dragon Shouts

  * **Frost Breath:** *Deals 30\60\120 Frost Damage to Health and Stamina.*  
Very much in theme for the build. It won't benefit from your perks but it will replace a spell in an emergency, especially if you want to keep your bow out at the time. Keep it equipped for emergencies.

  * **Ice Form:** *Targets are encased in ice and receive 5 Frost Damage to Health and Stamina for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
An excellent crowd control option. If there are too many enemies at one time, use this to put one in time out. Multiple enemies can be affected though don't depend on it since the area is narrow.

  * **Slow Time:** *Slows the time by 50\60\70% for 10\20\30 seconds.*  
An emergency button. Slowing the time can allow you to back away and set down additional runes in your enemy's path. If they survive, they'll be slowed down even more by the Frost effects, making them ripe targets for your arrows.

</details>

## Enchantments

> Full enchanting information can be found on the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) description page.

<details>

#### Weapon

* **Frost Damage:** *Deals 30 Frost Damage to Health and Stamina.*
* **Weakness to Frost:** *Reduces enemy Frost Resistance by 50% for 30 seconds.*
* **Absorb Magicka:** *Absorbs 30 Magicka. Targets whose Magicka is depleted resist this effect.*

It's hard to say which is better of the Frost enchantments. Additional damage does not benefit from your multitude of perks however it's an additional way to apply slow effects to your enemies. Lowering their resistance is only beneficial if you've laid runes or summoned an atronach. You can choose both eventually, thankfully. Otherwise, *Absorb Magicka* can mitigate the drawback of the *Atronach Stone* if you're running into issues managing Magicka.

#### Head

* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*
* **Fortify Destruction Cost:** *Your Destruction spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Conjuration Cost:** *Your Conjuration spells cost 25% less.*

If you have the ability to boost your Archery damage, do so. Otherwise, you cast enough spells from either school that the Magicka savings are noticeable and better than other options you have in this slot.

#### Chest

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Cost:** *Your Destruction spells cost 25% less.*
* **Fortify Conjuration Cost:** *Your Conjuration spells cost 25% less.*

With your atronach and your bow you aren't usually in the crosshairs but extra Magic Resistance never hurts. Otherwise, you can use this slot to make your spells cheaper, or even cheaper if you've the same enchantment on your head.

#### Gloves

* **Fortify Potions:** *Your potions last 50% longer.*
* **Fortify Sneak Attacks:** *You deal 25% more damage with sneak attacks and spells.*
* **Fortify Magicka:** *Your Magicka is increased by 50.*

Your investment in Alchemy gives you access to powerful potions and not just the healing variety. You can capitalize on that here or you can embrace your inner stealth archer for more damage. Lastly, a Magicka boost can be the lift needed to cast a more powerful spell in a pinch. 

#### Boots

* **Fortify Stamina:** *Your Stamina is increased by 50.*
* **Fortify Stamina Regeneration:** *Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*

Extra Stamina will help you fire more arrows. Otherwise, this slot is flexible and can bolster your resistances, carry weight, or stealth. You shouldn't be suffering on Carry Weight or Sneak, honestly, but it's up to you.

#### Necklace

* **Fortify Archery:** *You deal 25% extra damage with ranged weapons.*
* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*

A very high-value slot. You're able to boost your main sources of damage here or further protect yourself from nasty magical attacks. Getting more out of your bow is always a win but necklaces are lightweight. You could easily carry multiple as needed.

#### Ring

* **Resist Magic:** *Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.*
* **Fortify Destruction Power:** *Your Destruction spells are 25% stronger.*
* **Resist [Element]:** *Your [Element] Resistance is increased by 50%.*

The ring slot is very similar to your necklace. Use it to shore up your defenses against the arcane or, if you're feeling secure, boost your Frost damage further. This is another place where you can carry multiple options without weighing yourself down.

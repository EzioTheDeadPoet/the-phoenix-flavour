![Slidikins' Strenuous Skyrim](/Pictures/sss/sss.png)

**Slidikins’ Strenuous Skyrim (SSS)** is an extension of **[The Phoenix Flavour (TPF)](/tpf/introduction/)**, The Phoenix Flavour itself is not required as everything you need will be provided through [Wabbajack installation](installation%20Guide.md).

**What to expect from The Phoenix Flavour:**  
* **A Better Skyrim:** The guide includes hundreds of mods across several dozen categories, all carefully selected to fit Phoenix’s vision of a lore-friendly, improved but not radically changed Skyrim. The Phoenix Flavour strives to provide a solid upgrade of the vanilla experience with modern visuals and rebalanced gameplay.
* **Custom Files and Patches:** Both the final patch as well as some patches and plugin replacers installed during the mod setup have been made specifically for the guide by Umgak and Phoenix. They ensure compatibility as well as consistency between all included mods.
* **Performance:** The Phoenix Flavour was created for gameplay rather than screen-archery and will for most people deliver solid framerates on a 1080p monitor resolution. For higher resolutions, better hardware is required. Through INI changes, reasonable texture resolutions, a performance-friendly grass overhaul as well as a skippable ENB section and the choice to use lower settings in DynDOLOD, you can tweak your game until you reach a stable framerate.
* **Stability:** Skyrim SE itself is already very stable compared to Classic Skyrim. You may still experience the occasional freeze or crash, but they will be very rare (perhaps once every 20 to 30 hours). These happen in Vanilla and they will happen in TPF.

**Key differences between SSS and base TPF:**
* **Survival Mode:** It uses [_Survival Mode_](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) from the Creation Club, meaning you’ll need to eat, sleep, and keep warm alongside other changes.
* **Reduced HUD:** Your HUD will be minimized to limit on-screen information. You’ll no longer see enemy information or active effects while in combat, for example, and will need to use your intuition and context clues to assess your opponents.
* **Strict Level Cap:** Maximum level is 50 with a total of 55 perk points granted. Use them wisely. Additionally, skills also can not be made Legendary.
* **Equipment Upkeep:** The level cap puts more importance on your equipment choices. Weapon and armor tempering degrades over time as well.
* **Preparedness Rewarded:** Enemies will learn additional perks and spells as they level, making for harder encounters. Bringing the right tools for the job--along with accounting for [_Resistances and Weaknesses_](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45253)--will go a long way towards preventing stalls in your adventures.

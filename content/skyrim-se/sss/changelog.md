## Release 5.0.0b

**This update is not save-safe. A new game is required.**

After a massive wait, I've decided to push 5.0.0 into beta with a few known issues still on the table. The biggest are that the snow LODs don't 100% match the rest of the landscape, making for less-than-pretty Winter vistas. The other is that it snows when it's not supposed to, such as in the Summer. Mostly everything else is working as intended, however.

Okay, so what's new here is that a lot of mods have been switched out to continue supporting Auto Parallax. This is a visual departure from Aurora and not my typical focus so it's been a learning process on my end. Gameplay wise very little has changed.

The only thing separating this beta from a full 5.0.0 release has been my personal ability to play it. Once I've gone through the game and am confident the major bugs are squashed, the beta will be removed.

Pending a major update in any included mods, save files on this version should be compatible with the full release.

## Release 5.0.0a3

The good news is that Alpha 2 had no new issues. The bad news is that I haven't had time to test Alpha 3 before my upcoming 2-week vacation so I'm keeping it as an Alpha. Provided Alpha 3 has no major issues, the next version should be the beta. I don't expect there to be many problems here, maybe a few minor visual issues due to Dynamic Cubemaps or Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen, but the game is playable and most reports said the performance is great.

**Issues fixed since last Alpha:**  
- Characters carrying shields will properly use them for cover in the rain, equipped or not.
- Terrain blending is much better than it was.  
- Draugr are no longer insomniacs waiting for you in the last room of a dungeon.  
- Favorites menu controls *mostly* fixed. Pressing ESC/F4 to open the Journal still doesn't close it. I'll clean up these mods once it's sorted.

**Issues still unfixed:**
- Lots of green grass in snowy areas  
- Added Solstheim ash isn't snow covered in the winter  
- Random Dragons occassionally kill themselves (vanilla bug)  

**This Update is Save-Safe with the previous Alphas. Save inside before updating.**

## Release 5.0.0a2

Issues fixed since last Alpha:
- Starting the game with a controller plugged in should no longer crash the game. Nor should plugging one in after launching the game. However, you can't switch between KB&M and Controller at will anymore.
- Ultrawide options (21:9 and 32:9) are actually supported this time. Instructions on the Installation page have been updated to let people know what to do.
- The Abandoned Shack has all of its walls once again. It shouldn't have been *that* abandoned.
- DynDOLOD now uses the more stable DLL version. This results in a larger output file but should result in far, far fewer crashes when loading saves.

**This update is save-safe with 5.0.0a.** Just make sure to save indoors where DynDOLOD isn't active due to the new outputs.

## Release 5.0.0ɑ

> 2024-03-03

This update is big. It wasn't always meant to be that way. It was supposed to just be 4.19.1, the update where *Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen* was finally added in all of it's glory. However, as I went through making that happen and testing the results, I kept finding oddities that nagged at me until I was forced to reckon with the remnants of TPF 5.0 Beta that've been present in the list since 4.16.

As it removes all reference to TPF 5.0, it's only fitting that this version is called SSS 5.0 itself. A quick, quick summary of the massive list of changes below:

- Visuals have been overhauled. New lighting, new weather, a lot of new textures, and a switch from ENB to *Community Shaders*. The game is brighter with a fresh coat of paint, and should perform even better on your computer.
- *Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes* has been removed. Still a great mod but it's been marked for removal since SSS 4.16 and this was finally the time to rip off the bandaid. Items have returned to *mostly* vanilla stats (there's still [Armor Rating Adjustment for Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83825)) for better consistency with added items.
- More Questing *At Your Own Pace*. The Companions and Thieves Guild have been switched over to the mod series, giving a bit more uniformity to the three main factions.
- *Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen* in all of its glory. The game's calendar has been changed to 28 day **seasons** so you'll see the change 3x as frequently as you would previously. The game starts in the middle of Summer where things are at their most temperate, followed by Autumn which is what most people are used to. Use this time to prepare for the brutal Winter Skyrim is known for.

**This version absolutely needs a new save file! Don't even try it. Seriously. Crash City.** Also keep is mind that this is an *Alpha* release. There's no guarantee that the next release will be save-safe with this one. This is primarily for testing and working out the bugs before releasing a *Beta* which is expected to be more stable and likely to be save-safe with the full release.

## Release 4.19.0.3

> 2024-01-22

Well, that was a waste of time. There's no longer a "Best of Both Worlds" approach to this, I'm learning, so the list has been reverted fully to 1.6.640 exes, plugins, and archives. This means it's no longer compatible with updated USSEP and a few mods I wanted to put into 4.19.1, but it also won't have the odd bugs that have been plaguing the list since 4.19.0.1. Hopefully.

<details>

#### Changes

- **Official Master Files:** Reverted all archives and plugins back to 1.6.640 versions
- **Creation Club:** Removed the Resource Pack
- **SkyUI:** Reverted SkyUI - Remove QuickSave Button back to its original version
- **Essentials:** Removed Backported Extended ESL Support
- **Widescreen Support:** Reverted SkyUI - Remove QuickSave Button - 21x9 Aspect Ratio Support back to its original version
- **Configuration:** Hid the Stealth Meter through SkyHUD as well as previous methods

### Updates

- Downgraded Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch to 4.9.2a
- Updated Enemies Respect Encounter Zones to 1.4.2

#### Outputs

- Regenerated Synthesis Patches
- Regenerated LODGen
- Regenerated TexGen
- Regenerated DynDOLOD (and Performance)

## Release 4.19.0.2

> 2024-01-20


Bethesda released a second update (1.6.1170) which means another recompile is necessary in order to keep the list installable on WJ. And it's for the better, as 4.19.0.1 handled that last update (1.6.1130) poorly and there were stability issues. I'm hoping that's fixed now with this release.

The executables (and SKSE) are remaining on 1.6.640. The rest (plugins and archives) are using the newest versions that Steam and Bethesda provide. There should be no more mismatching references and all of the bugs that generated. Other than that, I mainly stuck to mod updates since the last release, and some bug fixes I had discovered while working on 4.19.1.

**A New Game is not required for this update**, but honestly I'd still recommend it. The saves I tested seem to make the jump just fine.

**ATTENTION:** Download instructions for the list have changed with this update. Verify your game files in Steam to make sure you're on 1.6.1170, then open the game and download the DLC content from the Creation market. Regardless if you own the AE Content Pack or not, you need the versions of the free Creations from that menu to install the list.

## Release 4.19.0.1

> 2023-12-11

So, Bethesda went ahead and updated Skyrim, mostly for reasons I don't agree with nor want to get into but it required me to update the list in order for Wabbajack to work again. So, here's a few updates to go along with the mandatory back-end changes.

**Note:** I did not have time to fully test this but I've no reason to believe it's any less stable than the version prior. I've left all vanilla archives the same with the exception of `Skyrim - Misc.bsa` and the list continues to run on 1.6.640. I also did not update MO2 to v2.5.0, although I've included archives for that update as well as some of the plugins that would also need installing. I don't plan on making the jump to the newest version of SSE anytime soon, so mods such as USSEP and AI Overhaul (which was updated for USSEP) have not been touched.

**This works with existing 4.19.0 saves.**

Peep the details below for the full change list. The only big thing I'll note is that SimonRim's suite has seen a number of updates that you may want to check out individually (respective updates to the Example Builds will come later, stealthily), and that I've removed `Use Or Take` and `Read or Take`. They are great and useful mods, however without visible Activation text I found that they add confusion for players who don't know they're there.

## Release 4.19.0

> 2023-11-25

At long last, we're at version 4.19! **This will require a new save file if you're on anything other than the 4.19.0 beta.** So, what's new with this version?

Firstly, there's been a lot of attention given to *Seasons of Skyrim*, expanding the areas it affects, making sure it looks more how it should, and even letting it affect alchemy ingredient availability. To make that more manageable, the calendar has been adjusted so that each season is only 30 in-game days, down from 90. (Some of you may remember me playing around with [*Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71967) but it was ultimately dropped. Perhaps in 4.20 that will be revisited.)

Secondly, a good number of bugs have been addressed. I want to give a big thanks to everyone on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/xRrHRsb5e9) that reported the issues. I know I didn't get to resolve every last one, but the fixes I did include help make this release even more polished than the last.

Outside of that you won't see too many major gameplay changes from 4.18. *Fishing* is a bit more robust in that you'll now need bait (read: cheap bug ingredients) to participate and [*Candlehearth*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97542) gives you the option to store goods in inns. Many mods have been updated, however, and there's a few gameplay changes to be found in the pile of changelogs. Nothing that would surprise you.

**A new save is required for this update.**

As always, if you run into any issues, let me know and I'll try and have it fixed in the next update.

## Release 4.18.0.7

> 2023-10-07

We might as well call this the [*Artificer*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99619) Update. Simon's newest overhaul tackles the Unique Artifacts of the game which required a bit of reconfiguring on my part. It also clashes with *Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes'* changes, though since it's just on unique items it's not the biggest problem in the world. Anyway, in cases where Artificer kept vanilla values, I carried over the WACCF changes. But if Artificer rebalanced the item altogether, chances are I went with Simon's changes. Until there's an official patch saying otherwise, that's how I handled the conflicts and I'll likely make tweaks to this in future patches.

I also did some cleaning up to match *Aurora's* previous removal of optional sections. I kept all of the mods I personally used and moved them to respective sections. Last but not least, I added [*Dremora Lines Expansion*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100562) to give them some well-needed dialogue attention. Other than that, the update is full of mod updates and minor bug fixes.

**This update is save-safe.**

> **Pro-tip:** Artificer's Oghma Infinium grants two extra perk points when read, raising the maximum number of perks to 57 for those who progress through the main quest to that point. This may be a valuable bump for most builds.

## Release 4.18.0.6

> 2023-09-08

Oh joyous days! [DroppedIceCream released a showcase and review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTG1vVzgsFM) of this list! Go check it out! Of the many things said that made me happy, hearing that it was one of the most stable lists he's tried made me especially proud. That said,  *Skill of Sneaking* currently causes crashes so I'm releasing an update to roll that back to a stable version. Sorry, sneaky folks!

Fortunately, Aurora updated in the last few days which means this update also gives you Xavbio's newest retextures, Yuril's [Windhelm Graveyard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98260), and a few more fixes from SME. I also went through Aurora mod by mod and found a few small differences between the lists that were unintentional. Those have been fixed. Sadly, *Ethereal Elven Overhaul* was removed for neck seam issues so the FaceGen files needed to be regenerated yet again.

**This update is save-safe.**

## Release 4.18.0.5

> 2023-09-03

Another small maintenance update while time allows. Among the mod updates is a notable change to *Dragon War* and the inclusion of Delta's newest mod, [*Dragon Hunting*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99193), which adds a few more alchemical ingredients to the giant lizards of Skyrim among other changes.

As *Aurora* has not yet updated, certain visual releases such as Xavbio's most recent armor retextures have not been included in this update, but they may be coming soon. In the meantime I'll continue looking into any issues that crop up. So if you find any, please come to the [Aetherius Modding](https://discord.gg/xRrHRsb5e9) server and let me know!

## Release 4.18.0.4

> 2023-08-23

It was inevitable with so much time passing between updates: I missed some things. This update is much smaller than the last and mainly exists to clean up things that should've been in 4.18.0.3. The outstanding bugs I mentioned previously are still being looked into. None are game-breaking, don't worry.

This update is save-safe.

\* If you downloaded this update early, you may notice that the two COTN Missives patches are present but disabled in the load order. This was intentional as enabling them made the boards invisible in Falkreath and Winterhold. The cause of this was the rogue master, `Missives.esp`, coming after the patches in the load order. If you move both plugins down in priority to be after `Missives.esp`, you may re-enable them.

## Release 4.18.0.3

> 2023-08-21

It's been awhile. I was away from home for work and during that time a number of interesting mods hit the Nexus, some of them are included in this update. [Gourmet - A Cooking Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96876) takes over for Apothecary's Food Addon. Not much has changed as far as how food works, but obtaining and making food has been overhauled quite a bit. From the author of Lawless - A Bandit Overhaul comes [Madmen - A Forsworn Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98579), bringing some of the same enemy design philosophies to the Reach as we have with draugr and bandits (and dragons)!

Outside of that it's been a few quality of life or fixes added here or there. There are some bug reports I still wish to investigate but that would require more time. For now I wanted to get this update out to fix a number that has already been accounted for.

## Release 4.18.0.2

> 2023-07-10

A bigger update than I originally planned, this one could almost be considered 4.18.1! Aurora changed a lot on the visual side of things, especially with character appearance, so brace yourself for that when you jump back into your save file. You might need to type `showracemenu` into the console to make adjustments to your Dragonborn since their look has likely changed.

On top of that we have the inclusion of [*Sorcerer*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196). Like a few other SimonRim mods this hangs on the edge of the list's scope. I've decided to include it mostly due to its built in rebalancing of magic merchant inventories. The staff and scroll crafting is a little more "new mechanics" but truthfully it's not anything new alongside Dragonborn's vanilla crafting, *Oblivion*, and *Arachnomancy* which are already in the list.

People who play in 1st Person mode will see some differences due to [*Improved Camera*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93962). I'm sure there are a few more settings I need to tweak for complete compatibility but, for now, I think it's working pretty well.

**This update is save-safe!** Let me know if you run into any issues. There are still a handful of inconsequential things I want to squash but no luck on those just yet.

## Release 4.18.0.1

> 2023-07-03

Just a quick fix for a few issues I noticed personally. For starters, I've removed multiple Apothecary patches in lieu of a unified Anniversary Update patch. That should make the recipes more consistent and up to date. Then I noticed a lot of issues with the *New Armory Series - Lunar Weapons* integration. That's on me as I didn't properly check over it after reverting away from the TPF 5.0 beta. They should have the proper enchantments and tooltips now, and vanilla Silent Moons weapons should no longer appear.

Other than that, tiny quality of life changes. Stealing items undetected will give Sneak exp based on the value of what was stolen. Potions are no longer distractingly bright (but still emit some light). And [Photo Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91701)! Access it from the System Menu or just hit `P`.

**This update is save-safe for 4.18 users.**

## Release 4.18.0

> 2023-06-29

This update has been simmering for a long time and I apologize to everyone who's had to wait patiently while its aroma drifted over them. But the wait is over: **4.18 is here!**

Let's start with the visuals. I've removed some more deviations I've made from Aurora such as *eFPS* and *Enhanced Landscapes* so that the visuals are more in line with Phoenix's amazing work. I've also switched back to *Realistic Water Two* which is Aurora's water mod of choice. We're still using RAID Weathers and The Vanilla ENB 2 since I want stealth mechanics to remain predictable in a game with no stealth meter. *Frozen Electrocuted Combustion* has also been removed. It's a good mod but there are some weird interactions and ultimately the effects take away some of the visual oomph of the late-game Destruction perks. (I still haven't sorted out the LOD unload bug in the winter, unfortunately. If you experience it, just save and reload where you are.)

Gameplay is where the meat of the update lies. *[Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659)* has been added alongside the *Adamant - Bard Perks Addon* to move shouts into a perk tree everyone can benefit from and add more functionality to Speech tree respectively. As such, shouts as a whole have a different approach compared to *Forceful Tongue* and I've updated the Example Builds section to account for the changes. Enemy resistances have also changed slightly with a switch to *[Enemy Resistance Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59394)*. Last but not least of the big gameplay changes is the removal of *Honed Metal*. It's been in the list a long time but it's been hard to balance it the way I've wanted *and* its features are quickly becoming redundant. Instead of removing it in a few months I've decided to rip the bandaid off now. The [gameplay guide](/skyrim-se/sss/gameplay-guide) has been updated to reflect this as well.

**THIS UPDATE IS NOT SAVE-SAFE.** Please start a new game. Please.

(Unless you've been using the 4.17.1 beta. Then you can install this after first Uninstalling Honed Metal via its MCM. *Stormcrown* also made some changes since 1.1.4 that might result in funkiness so a new game is *encouraged* but not required.)

## Release 4.17.0.2

> 2023-05-18

This update was left on the backburner for a few reasons but I've decided to push it out today assuming the next update will require a new game. Why will the next update require a new game, you ask? Because [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) released and some of you might have talked to Paarthurnax already. There are a few other mods that I'm thinking of switching out as well, so I'm considering this a good staging point for figuring out the next steps.

Another reason the update was stalled was because I wanted to update the Example Builds section a bit more. I haven't gotten around to all the changes I wanted to implement so the builds are slightly out of date with Simonrim. I plan on giving them all some polishing with the Stormcrown update as the shouts sections will obviously need adjusting.

The changelog looks lengthy but there aren't too many big changes. Just some gameplay updates to be aware of, such as the Blade and Blunt - Health Regeneration Addon. With this, you will regenerate Health back to 50% regardless of Survival mechanics, but you'll still need other means of recovery if you want to get back to full Health.

There's also a known LOD bug that's most noticeable in the Winter season. If you notice weird flickering or floating snow in your travels, just save and reload in place and it should fix itself. Hopefully this is fully fixed in newer versions of DynDOLOD, but for now it's something we have to live with.

## Release 4.17.0.1

> 2023-04-23

There were a few issues with the release of 4.17. Thank you SAEL in particular for catching the bulk of them and bringing them to my attention. The root cause of some was the Embers XD 2.7.4 beta, rather, the existing patches that did not account for it. Since I went through the trouble of fixing those, the beta stays in this version despite it being temporarily "retired" by mindflux on the Nexus. If that causes issues, I'll revert back to 2.7.3 and undo the fixes.

More importantly, *NPCs Learn Skills and Spells* has been removed. It was a fun experiment but now that Lawless and The Dragon Cult exist, we have a lot more intention with the enemy overhauling. We don't need SPID buffing up the enemies even more, and it turns out it was buffing them much more than intended. Sorry to everyone who ran into Lv1 bandits summoning atronachs, that should be fixed now.

Otherwise, it's a small update that follows its base list, [Aurora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/898050), in its official 1.0 release! Congrats to Phoenix for delivering another solid modlist to the community.

**This update is save-safe.**

- **Utilities & Frameworks:** Added Beautifully Overhauled and Objectively Better Icons Enriched for SkyUI
- **ElSopa's Potions Redone:** Added ElSopa - Potions Redone - Apothecary Patch
- **Magic & Perks:** Removed NPCs Learn Skills and Spells (as it's incorrectly processing NPCs)
- **Conflict Resolution:** Resolved differences between Embers XD and Frozen Electrocuted Combustion for FireFXShader `0001B212`
- **Conflict Resolution:** Resolved differences between Embers XD and No Edge Glow for DarkElfAncestorWrathFXShader `0010F56C`

## Release 4.17.0

> 2023-04-17

There's no changelog here. There was one, once. It was massive and I lost it in the ether. After that there were hundreds of other changes made. I should do better. Another time, perhaps.

But this is a **huge** update, make no mistake. If you're coming from 4.16.0.*x*, just **make a new save file**. It's not save-safe. If you're coming from 4.16.1.*x* **you probably should also make a new save** but it's possibly salvageable. So what's changed?

As I mentioned in the last release candidate, Phoenix is back and they've changed their approach to TPF 5.0. It will be built on **Aurora** which is built on **Skyrim Modding Essentials**. This makes it very streamlined for Phoenix, building each list right on top of the other. So I've gone ahead and tossed out pretty much everything visual and also made this list based off of Aurora's release candidate (RC5 currently). It looks fantastic and the textures were selected with a lot more care than I'm capable of. I still kept RAID Weathers (and RAID), Water for ENB, and The Vanilla ENB Two, so it's not exactly the same as Aurora, but it's close.

The gameplay sections have moved around in anticipation for TPF 5.0. Phoenix has been posting their documentation and I can see how things are formatted for the future. I don't know which mods will be in TPF 5.0 so I've more or less smashed the current gameplay mod sections into their new separators and called it a day. When TPF comes out I will take notes on what direction Phoenix went in and adjust, but this list may just continue being an Aurora fork.

- Could I have been more discerning and gone through every mod to see if I still liked it? Sure.
- Will I do that at a later date? Probably.
- What's this then? I suppose technically it's still a SSS 5.0 beta, but the official WJ download has been neglected for awhile so I thought to bring everyone up to speed with this release.
- Does this need more polish? On the back end, sure. The game should play great and look great. I just need to clean things up from an organization perspective.

No, seriously, at some point I'll get around to cleaning up the load order and sorting out the CR patches to look less work-in-progress. But since the list is based off of two of Phoenix's release candidates, perhaps work-in-progress is how it's supposed to look.

Overall, I've taken Phoenix's visual overhaul from Aurora, trimmed down the added equipment from TPF 5.0, but otherwise kept its bug fixes and changes to quests/NPCs until TPF 5.0 is officially released. At which point I'll decide if I'm going to be a fork off Aurora or a fork off TPF and tweak accordingly.

tl;dr changes from 4.16.2 RC 1:  
- Visuals overhauled to match Aurora RC5
- Phoenix's Weapons & Armor Overhaul removed in lieu for a restored Weapons, Armor, Clothing, and Clutter Fixes
- Some of the added weapons and armor (e.g. Stalhrim Extra Crafting) was removed until balance can be better achieved
- Optional difficulty modules removed, Aurora optionals maintained

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.

Seriously though, **start a new save file.**


## Release 4.16.2 RC 1

> 2023-03-05

It's been a few weeks since the last release candidate and we've found some issues that have been ironed out. The Uncapper should work as intended now with its latest update, Hulking Draugr shouldn't lower your attack speed into oblivion, and Simon has released a handful of fixes and updates before taking a well-deserved break. I'm still not entirely comfortable calling it a full release but we're close. Provided there's no huge issues with this update, it will go live on Wabbajack.

In other news, Phoenix has returned from their break! Alongside that news are changes to how they're approaching TPF 5.0 and their other lists and those changes will eventually trickle down into SSS. For instance, there will be a visuals-only list that will essentially replace the visuals here once it's released. I've recently taken visuals into my own hands with this release candidate but honestly I regret it and will love to put that back into Phoenix's hands. On that note, I've added the new xavbio armor and weapons textures where they've been patched for *Modular Armory*.

Other major additions for this release include a number of quality of life mods in the crafting world such as *Recipe Auto-Learn* and *Cooking Categories Improvement.* Crafting menus all around should be nicely sorted and discovering new alchemical effects should be a smidge less trial and error.

**This update is safe-save.** Just save in an interior cell before updating due to the change in DynDOLOD outputs.

Also, full disclosure, Lux updated everything in the final moments before pushing this update so I haven't had time to properly test out the changes (which haven't even been posted at this time) or re-run the LODs. There might be minor issues. This is precisely the type of thing I want to avoid by letting Phoenix handle the visuals.

## Release 4.16.1 RC 3

> 2023-02-13

It's been a little over a week and I've a short trip coming up so I wanted to put out an update before then. Thank you everyone that's been helping me test so far (and big thanks to Berna for finding some bugs to squash!) but I don't think it's quite ready for a full release just yet. This update is mostly just updates to existing mods, however one of those mods is *The Vanilla ENB Two* which had a huge update since RC 2 came out. Overall it's an amazing step forward and I love how it looks but it does come with a bit of a performance hit. I'm not sure if I tweaked the Performance Profile enough to compensate, but let me know if the hit's too much compared to the last release (and 4.16.0, even) so I can see what I can do about dialing it back.

**This update is save safe.** Nothing new has been generated. Have fun!

#### Changes

## Release 4.16.1 RC 2

> 2023-02-05

Whoops, that was a quick update. This one's short but impactful. If your character plans on doing a lot of sneaking around I'd advise restarting. You don't have to but the values won't be the intended. If not, you probably won't notice too much difference other than the lighting.

*EVLaS* is gone for now. Will it come back? Possibly, but it would require a workable adjustment for *The Vanilla ENB Two* in order to prevent some of the intense outdoor shadows you may have encountered. Even with that fix, the shaodws the mod produces don't actually affect your current light level, so hiding in them won't make you stealthier. It's misleading and in a game with no other indicators, not good design. So I had to drop it.

I also updated *DWTD* values so that *R.A.I.D.*'s settings properly pass through. Since *RAID Weathers* was designed with stealth in mind, some of DWTD's features were doubling down on what NPCs were already experiencing. I've turned off some of those features and left others, such as NPCs hearing less in the rain or searching a small radius in bad weathers.

R.A.S.S. was removed because it was on the fence to begin with, half of the mod was turned off and the other half wasn't looking great in action. *S.W.I.F.T.* was removed because it trivialized some of the established methods of fast traveling (carriage, ferry, spells) that existed through other mods. The mod itself is great but it doesn't fit the list.

All in all, an update centered around mods with initializations.

<details>

#### Changes

- **Weather & Lighting:** Removed Enhanced Volumetric Lighting and Shadows (EVLaS)
- **Fire & Visual FX:** Removed R.A.S.S. - Rain Ash And Snow Shaders
- **Fire & Visual FX:** R.A.S.S. - Rain Ash And Snow Shaders - Settings Loader
- **Architecture:** Fixed Windhelm Bridge Stairs... again
- **Combat & Encounters:** Edited Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection to properly detect RAID 3 plugins and set the correct settings
- **Skeletons & Animations:** Restored Missile's Immersive Equipment Display Presets
- **New Mechanics:** Removed Skyrim Wayshrines - Immersive Fast Travel
- **ENB:** Increased *AmbientLightingIntensityInteriorDay* and *AmbientLightingIntensityInteriorNight* to `1.00`

#### Outputs

- Regenerated DynDOLOD (and Performance)

## Release 4.16.1 RC 1

> 2023-02-04

This update should really be called *Slidikins' Strenuous Skyrim Release 5.0 RC 4* as it's essentially a complete rebuild of the list based off of *The Phoenix Flavour 5.0 RC 4* (which is currently unavailable). The changes in 4.15.5 was the first step towards this goal. The jump to SSE 1.6.640 in 4.16 put me within spitting distance. So, while I know that it's only been a week since that jump, I've decided to go the rest of the way.

The core of the list hasn't changed. It's still a Simonrim-centered TPF modlist with *Survival Mode* and my other choices, but TPF 5.0 has decided to venture off into the previously labeled "TPF-X" realm of added content. This update follows TPF down that path... some of the way. You'll find your Vanilla+ experience peppered with **new enemies, new equipment, expanded quests, more crafting options, and more**. What you won't find are the new worldspaces (areas), followers, or any content that requires the [Anniversary Upgrade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade). If you have that, keep an eye out for TPF's release as it will integrate most of it very well.

There's a lot of changes here. Seriously. The folder count went from ~800 to ~1400. The plugin count is through the roof. Part of that is due to the conflict resolution patches being separated out by section instead of being altogether. This might not be the case in the final release, however there's no reason not to leave it as is with the way ESL plugins work.

Anyway, a not-so-shortlist of sectional changes can be found below. Please, *please* let me know if you run into any issues. I almost guarantee that you will. I want to fix them.

> **This update is absolutely not save-safe.** It is likely that future release candidates will be but not guaranteed. If you want to safely continue your character on v4.16.0.1, my advice would be to manually update SimonMagus' mods so long as they're labeled save-safe and you'll be in good shape.

<details>

#### Changes

This changelog is structured differently because of how much has changed. Instead of an itemized list, I'll go through section by section and list some key differences from each, compared to [TPF 5.0 RC 4](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/the-phoenix-flavour-50-wip).

- **Utilities:** No big changes here. This section consists of pre-requisites for other mods, most of which were already in the list. I did not carry over *Optional Quick Start* from TPF 5.0 as I'm not a fan of the implementation.

- **Essential Mods:** Phoenix created her own *Weapons & Armor Overhaul* that supercedes *WACCF* here, otherwise this section is mostly untouched. Numerous mods from this section have been moved to sections below.

- **SKSE Plugins:** The section has been moved higher. There are a number of new plugins, almost all of which are small quality of life fixes such as *Stagger Direction Fix* or *Alchemy Plus*.

- **Fixes & Tweaks:** Can you believe there are so many things to fix after USSEP? And it's all in here. Again, not going to get into the weeds over things that are small bug fixes. "It just works."

- **Controls & Camera:** This section also moved upwards. *Sprint Swimming* is the newest addition here, otherwise it's the same as before. I've switched away from the *EasyEase Preset* to [SmoothCam Vanilla Enhanced 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82481) with very minor changes.

- **Interface:** I kept *Toggle Compass Hotkey* over *Ultimate Immersion Toggle*. I've also reverted back to regular *SkyUI* as the default interface. This allows for more consistency with *CoMAP* and *Constructible Object Custom Keyword System*, both new additions in this update. There is an optional *Nordic UI* section for those who still want the old look but it's not at the same level of consistency. Widescreen support is still present for 21x9 monitors (*SkyUI* only; for other ratios or *Nordic UI* support you have to install it on your own). I've tried my best to make sure both UI looks work with the same configuration file.

- **Graphic Baseline:** Not much to say here. The Performance Profile does not utilize *High Poly Project* otherwise it's not an exciting section to talk about. To look at is a different story.

- **Mesh Improvements:** Likewise, TPF 5.0 just makes things look prettier here and I saw no reason to change these choices.

- **Weather & Lighting:** This is the first major departure from TPF 5.0. I've switched *Obsidian Weathers* out for *RAID Weathers* but left everything else the same. Previous versions of the list did not have reliable stealth mechanics which was a sore spot given the reduced HUD. By switching back to *RAID* and *RAID Weathers* sneaking around is tough but fair, the way I intended.

- **Fire & Visual FX:** I've added *R.A.S.S. - Rain Ash and Snow Shaders* on top of TPF 5.0. I've also kept all of my previous additions such as *Frozen Electrocuted Combusion*. I'm borderline on R.A.S.S. so please let me know what you think.

- **Landscape:** I kept pretty much everything here, the most noticeable of which was *Enhanced Landscapes* to make exploring a bit more memorable. Then I added a bunch of MystiriousDawn's new HD Parallax textures.

- **Trees, Grass, & Plants:** Essentially the same as TPF 5.0, which is the same as TPF 4.0 with the addition of *Happy Little Trees* and some of the *Cathedral - 3D* plants.

- **Appearance:** Unchanged as this section was adopted by SSS in earlier versions.

- **Architecture:** No real changes from TPF 5.0 aside from *Rally's Market Stalls*. Things look good here.

- **Misc Structures:** Again, no real changes. For the most part I've always agree with Phoenix's visuals and that hasn't changed.*Daedric Shrines* was put here as the only addition from a later section of the list.

- **Interiors:** Nothing to say here that hasn't already been said.

- **Dungeons:** The retexture section of the changelog is quite boring, isn't it?

- **Clutter:** I should note that TPF 5.0 switched from the desaturated version of *Book Covers Skyrim* to the saturated version. All the books in the game will be brighter than before.

- **Valuables:** For some reason *Security Overhaul SKSE* was moved here. Otherwise, nothing interesting to note.

- **Food & Ingredients:** I've added *Garlic - A Garlic Mod* to the section. It came out after the last release candidate but I feel that Phoenix would've loved it.

- **Apparel & Weapons:** Unchanged from TPF 5.0 as it was already incorporated into SSS awhile back.

- **Creatures:** Unchanged from TPF 5.0.

- **Gameplay Overhauls:** The SimonRim core of TPF remains untouched.

- **Balance & Crafting:** TPF 5.0 expands the crafting a good amount and SSS followed it all the way down that road. The biggest thing to note here is that TPF 5.0 modifies the Smithing tree along with its other changes. *Honed Metal* has not been adjusted to compensate so there may be some weirdness with the blacksmith services.

- **Non-Player Characters:** Children get more clothes with *Prince and the Pauper* returning to the list. Vigilants as well. Otherwise, this is a mostly unchanged section that introduces a few small tweaks to the list.

- **Improved Vanilla Quests:** TPF 5.0 fleshes this section out even more with a lot of minor tweaks. *At Your Own Pace* has been added for the main quest and the College of Winterhold. The other factions have gotten some attention as well to improve their quest pacing.

- **Combat & Encounters:** Nothing really changed here. Like Gameplay Overhauls, the core of the list hasn't changed.

- **Miscellaneous:** Phoenix added a number of small mods to this section such as *Jarrin Root for Babette*. *Left Hand Rings* is included so that the Bond of Matrimony can be worn without taking up a valuable enchantment slot. One that I didn't take was *Another Redbelly Mine Mod* because, put frankly, I don't care all too much about the dialogue conflict here. It's an easy mine to enter, let's leave it as an iron mine like all the other easy mines to enter.

- **Skeleton & Animations:** I left this mostly unchanged which is a departure from TPF 5.0 because it added *Movement Behavior Overhaul* and *Animated Armoury*. The former was glitchy for me and I didn't think the latter fit the current vision of the list and there are no added weapon types here, so I dropped them. *Precision* returns, however, as it was not the true source of the previous issue.

- **Sound FX:** I know less about sound than I do visuals. This section was left as is.

- **Creation Club:** This list only uses the 4 free Creations that came with Anniversary Edition so the others have been removed, drastically slimming down the next few sections.

- **Creation Club Base:** I did my best to preserve what could be used here with the above limitation which wasn't much. In addition, previous enhancements to *Saints and Seducers*, *Survival Mode*, and *Fishing* were moved here.

- **Creation Club Assets:** Unchanged from TPF 5.0 aside from the aforementioend trim.

- **Creation Club Patches:** Included everything necessary for the utilized Creations.

- **Creation Club Integreation:** This has been reduced to Phoenix's patches and *Mysticism - Survival Spells Addon*.

- **Beyond Skyrim Bruma, Wyrmstooth, City Overhauls, Other Locations, Interior Overhauls, and New Player Homes:** Not included in SSS.

- **New & Expanded Quests:** Some of these were introduced in the last update. Most, actually. I did not add *Cheesemod for EVERYONE* and *New Treasure Hunt*, however.

- **New Mechanics:** *Hand to Hand* and *Pilgrim*, among others, were already in the list. I've added *Skyrim Wayshrines* and *BA Bard Songs*. *Wayshrines* provides another alternative to fast traveling but you'll incur fatigue in exchange for the transmission. Left out were some CC-dependent mechanics, *Take A Peek*, *Skyrim's Got Talent*, and *Skyrim's Paraglider*.

- **New Items:** A lot. I mean, there's a lot of new, lore friendly gear to outfit yourself with here. Before it was just *Royal Armory* and *Ancient Nord Stahlrim*. Now it's a proper section.

- **New Creatures:** This was called "New NPCs & Creatures" in TPF 5.0 but I didn't carry over a single NPC so just ignore that first part. You still get plenty of new monsters to fight and a handful more alchemical ingredients to play around with from this section.

- **New Animations:** In addition to the previous animations I've added to the list, TPF 5.0 adds almost all of Verolevi's animations (with *Conditional Armor Type Animations*) to the game. In action all of these new animations looked nice and made sense, so I left them in.

- **New Music:** Nothing has changed here.

- **Content Integration:** Without certain CC mods the *Crossbow Integration* part of this section got neutered but I kept what I could. You should also see more Bonemold and Chitin and merchants will have more gear from across Tamriel even if you can't go there yourself.

- **Lux, Lux Orbis, & Lux Via:** These mods are so big they need their own section. I've included everything that was necessary given the other choices in the modlist.

## Release 4.16.0.1

> 2023-01-27

This is mostly a hotfix to deal with some bugs that have been reported. One in particular was considered a critical bug which meant this update goes out sooner rather than later. Below is a list of the issues addressed:

- Adjusted Scrambled Bugs settings so that all of Simonrim's perks and effects should act as the author intended.
- Dragons no longer magically obtain a smaller hitbox vs. projectiles, allowing archers and mages to actually kill them again.
- Innkeepers should properly give you a bounty letter when asked. If you decline the quest it won't be offered again immediately.
- The Windhelm bridge should have its proper textures.
- Unique weaponry should have all of their correct meshes/textures and a few stats have been tweaked to match Phoenix's intent.

A new save is not required. You will receive a warning about `Precision.esp` that can be ignored.

<details>

#### Changes

- **Architecture:** Added Windhelm Fence 3D
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Removed Precision
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Removed Precision Creatures
- **Improved Vanilla Quests:** Moved Headhunter - Bounties Redone to Miscellaneous
- **Skeleton & Animations:** Removed Nemesis Creature Behaviour Compatibility
- **Configuration:** Lowered SkillFormulaCaps to 100 (this won't change much of anything as Simonrim bonuses tend not to give raw skill boosts, I'm just cleaning up the file)
- **Configuration:** Adjusted Scrambled Bugs settings to match Simon's suggestions for his gameplay suite

#### Updates

- Updated NVIDIA Reflex Support to 1.1.2
- Updated Dwemer Gates Don't Reset to 1.3.7
- Updated Papyrus Tweaks to 4.0
- Updated Rally's Nord War Horns to 1.3
- Updated Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul to 1.1.2
- Updated Honed Metal Revoiced to 1.8

#### Outputs

## Release 4.16.0

> 2023-01-23

I'll be clear: **this is a new chapter for Slidikins' Strenuous Skyrim.** I've decided to rip off the proverbial band-aid and bring the list up to date to Skyrim SE 1.6.640. With that comes a handful of changes and a lot of new opportunities. Since a new game would've been required anyway, I also took the liberty of cramming in a ton of mods that also would've meant starting fresh. The end result is this monster of a changelog that I promise is totally the same SSS you've come to enjoy. Let's get into it!

#### Mod Substitutions

Not every SKSE plugin made the jump to 1.6.640. Most of them have been replaced with something comparable, such as *PlayerPayCrimeGold Tweak* filling in for *No Crime Teleport*. In two cases a substitute didn't exist (such as *SSE Gameplay Tweaks*). It's unfortunate but the features lost weren't vital to the list.

Outside of SKSE plugins there were a few more changes. wSkeever's *Simplicity of Snow* and *Shaders of Solstheim* took over for *Better Dynamic Snow/Ash*. *The Dragon Cult* replaced *Haugbui* which was a fine mod but not the best fit in comparison. You'll see a few others like these in the details below, such as the Lux series that's taken over the lighting.

#### Visual Changes

Since building the list off of TPF the philosophy has mostly been "focus on gameplay mods, let TPF handle the visuals." That has changed... slightly. I've been stepping out of that box a bit to include things such as MystiriousDawn's parallax landscape textures, *Seasons of Skyrim*, and borrowing from TPF 5.0's unreleased modlist. (Yes, that means ENB Complex Parallax is enabled in the regular profile.)

Even so, I don't like focusing on visuals and don't think this will lead to drastic changes in how the game looks. Expect to find more nuggets of visual changes here and there in future updates. *Lux* (and *Lux Via* and *Lux Orbis*) are the latest mods grabbed from TPF 5.0. Lighting will be noticeably different and stealth mechanics have changed slightly because of it. It'll probably be too easy still, but it's a work in progress.

#### Quest Expansions

JaySerpa's mods have always been on the cusp of making it into the list. I love pretty much all of their ideas but I have to ask myself, "Does this fit Vanilla+?" at every release. Well, the needle has moved to "Yes" for a lot of them, specifically the quest expansions. Alongside those you'll find other mods that enhance the existing quests of the game such as *Headhunter*, *Destination Weddings*, and *Extended Cut - Saints & Seducers*. That's right, *Saints & Seducers* is now part of the list!

#### Branching Further

With these and other changes, SSS has distanced itself from TPF that much more. It's still a TPF fork at its core but it's become impossible to convert TPF 4.16 to SSS 4.16 without a digital scalpel and a ton of time. As such, SSS' manual guide has been retired and installation is available only through Wabbajack. This will allow me to pile in some smaller mods (such as wSkeever's various fixes) without making installation more tedious, so expect to see these branches diverge even further as TPF 5.0 develops.

I haven't done justice to all of the changes in 4.16. Take a peek at the details below for a full list. There are some real gems in there.

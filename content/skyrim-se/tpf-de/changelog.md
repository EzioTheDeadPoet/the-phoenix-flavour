## Release 2.9

> 07.08.2022

**New save is required.**

About sad things, at first. Even thou I have asked people to fill in the feedback survey, at the moment I was writing this only 39 people have filled it up. After the first feedback survey was closed, 50 people were able to help thou the list at that time has being in use by less people. I have decided not to do the feedback report. I guess many just people don't care, so I won't care about reporting too much either. :P Thanks to those people, who really tried, you will be able to partially get the report by reading the changelog. We are going to see how it goes later, but soon the survey will be closed.

About happy things. I would say this update is more about polishing our landscapes, while also improving some other aspects of the game. Now you will able to enjoy Happy Little Trees in their full glory together with mods, which compliment them like Happy Little Shrubs and our improved LOD. Also welcome another band of cats to our Skyrim from Khajiit Will Follow, new content addition. Some of items from mods became much more unique thanks to Snazzy Items series of mods, while bards are more happy, because not only Dragonborn troubles them not as often as always, but also because now they reside in their beautiful JK's Bards College. Also now you can toggle animated traversal action markers by pressing `;` button.

Also our main page and the guides are now on Phoenix's website, feel free to check it out - https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/tpf-de. I have tried to make each documentation piece even better than before, so let's hope it will help even more people than before.

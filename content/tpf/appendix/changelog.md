## Release 4.8

> 18/09/2021

**TPF 4.8 will be the final update for the time being. The guide is entering indefinite hiatus.** Please check this [Patreon post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/september-update-56305694) for more information.

With this update, I am finally switching over TPF WJ to the brilliant stock game folder system. That means you no longer have to move any files (Game Folder Files) manually after installing - you can simply hit Run in Mod Organizer 2 and jump ingame once the installation finishes. This also means that WJ users can no longer decide between different ENB presets.

All tools are also once again included with the WJ installation.

The remaining changes in this update are rather minor. NifSkope is now being used to edit a few meshes (although those edits were marked as optional) and I updated 

**This update is save-safe.** It's primarily a major release because of the structural changes (which largely affect the WJ users and myself).

## Release 4.7.5

> 03/09/2021

This update consists of many smaller changes and additions largely related to graphics that accumulated while I was working on TPF-X. This also affected NPCs (I added a different makeup retexture) so facegen was regenerated.

**Removal of STAC:**

Smoking Torches and Candles was removed in this update because Umgak and I agreed that it doesn't look particularly good. Additionally, the effect may disappear entirely when there are too many particle effects on screen. There is also a performance impact, although it should be negligible for all but the weakest machines.

**Skyrim Remastered - High Hrothgar:**

My interest in [gochargers2156](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3302086) was already piqued when I came upon their comprehensive and beautiful ice, glacier, and ice cave overhauls which have been in TPF for a while now.

Upon checking through their published mods again I found [Skyrim Remastered - High Hrothgar v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51788). Not only does it include the meshes (UV fixes) from [T4's High Hrothgar overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22672?tab=description) that we are currently using, it also comes with *highly* improved door textures which were still vanilla and a huge eyesore in TPF. On top of that it includes [Pilgrim's Delight](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3273), but with higher res textures and 3D meshes for the steps similar to [Skyrim 3D High Hrothgar Steps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19905), but using projected snow so that the snowy steps blend with their surroundings.

In short, the mod is a huge improvement for TPF.

**Removal of Ancient Pottery:**

Mathy's meshes from [Ancient Pottery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24039) are as usual extremely high quality. However, I found that I preferred the more vanilla-like urns and more colourful pots from [Rudy HQ - Nordic Ruins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19365) (which also come with high quality meshes) as well as [Remiros' Dunmer Urns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50767) (which were already in TPF).

## Release 4.7.4

> 29/08/2021

**INI Updates:**

Thanks to @Judge Red on our Discord server, distant mountain peaks looking white are now fixed in most places. This was done by increasing the value to fBlockMaximumDistance and does not come with a performance impact. In my testing, some mountains may still look off (for instance I spotted one looking east from Katla's farm near Solitude), but they are far away and obscured by clouds so that they do not look like visual bugs.

**Projected Snow:**

Snow in TPF is alright, although distant snow can look really atrocious in places because of our noise.dds texture. This is something I'm working on. When working on 4.7.1 I tried a few alternative snow textures and texture tweaks, but ultimately ran out of time and reverted to the status quo.

Unfortunately, I forgot to re-add the additional instructions to Noble Skyrim where you create a projected diffuse texture so that regular snow and snow shaders (applied to rocks, roads, etc) match. If your snow is mismatched and looking awful right now, this is why. I brought these instructions back now and they will stay until we swap to a different snow texture for good.

Curiously enough, I remembered to recreate that file in MO2, so WJ members are unaffected at least.

**Controls & Camera:**

This (second-to-last) section was newly added because I felt this was a category of mods that could be a little more accurately sorted. With one exception (Parapets' Auto Input Switch) it consists of mods already present in the guide. While TPF does not have mods affecting the *camera* specifically, several official TPF addons do and their authors may appreciate a dedicated section.

**ENB Water Settings:**

I have been unhappy with the strongly turquoise water in TPF for a long time and finally got around to tweaking the enbseries.ini a little to get a bluer tone. It's not perfect and a true solution would be editing water colours in the Realistic Water Two plugin, but that's more work and will have to be looked into another time.

## Release 4.7.3

> 22/08/2021

This is a small update, mostly for Wabbajack users. I went through my own files and fixed a few issues. TPF is in a pretty good place right now and ready to be the foundation for my upcoming TPF-X Wabbajack list.

The current Cathedral Assets Optimiser instructions sparked some confusion, so I slightly changed the wording in the instructions. We already had "Downsize the mod with CAO" instructions for when the "Downsize Textures" profile was supposed to be selected. The other possibility is now "Optimise the mod with CAO" rather than "Run the mod through CAO" to clarify that the "Optimise SLE Assets" profile is supposed to be used.

#### Mod Installation

- **Fixes:** Removed Weapon Speed Effects Fix.
- **Landscape:** Updated the file name in the download instructions for Realistic Water Two.
- **Sound FX:** Updated download instructions for Immersive Sounds Compendium (using an Old File for the time being).

#### Wabbajack

- Updated Open World Loot - AVL Morrowind Glass Addon to 1.2
- Updated Misc Tweaks - Shrines Don't Cure Diseases to 1.9

## Release 4.7.2

> 18/08/2021

Due to some scheduling issues, TPF 4.7.1 never made it to Wabbajack. This update corrects that, but it also incorporates a few other fixes and changes for the manual guide as well as updated mods for both. The 4.7.1 Wabbajack changelog was moved here and expanded.

After a lot of digging, our moderator Slim discovered with the help of meh321 that a potential cause for the infamous **Dragonsreach infinite loading screen** (black screen) may have been No Grass In Objects without grass cache generated. I have removed the mod for the time being and hopefully the issue should go away. Of course it will be re-added (likely with pre-made, downloadable grass cache) once I have figured out how to set it up without stutters.

#### Mod Installation

- **Essential Mods:** Temporarily removed No Grass In Objects.
- **Fixes:** Updated additional instructions for Scrambled Bugs.
- **Fixes:** Fixed a very confusing typo in the additional instructions for Skyrim Ultimate Eyemeshes Ruhmastered.
- **Interface:** Actually removed DRELDYN's Original Main Menu Overhaul.

- **Graphics Baseline:** Updated FOMOD instructions for Fixed Mesh Lighting.
- **Graphics Baseline:** Added note to Fixed Mesh Lighting that conflicts with yet to be installed mods will be dealt with.
- **Visual FX:** Added instructions to remove some files from Arctic - Frost Effects Redux.
- **Landscape:** Clarified that files were supposed to be deleted from the main file of Skyrim Remastered - Glaciers and Ice.
- **Interiors:** Added FOMOD instructions for Solstheim Objects SMIMed - High Poly Dark Elf Furniture.

#### Performance Guide

- Fixed yet another reference to Rudy ENB in the INI settings.

#### TPF Addons

- Updated link for Slidikins' Strenuous Skyrim and updated notable additions list.
- Added GRIZZY'S CHOICE to the list of addons (undocumented 4.7.1 addition).

#### Wabbajack

- Fixed mod order for Inferno and Embers HD (Inferno should be below Embers HD)

## Release 4.7.1

> 15/08/2021

With this update the **Instructions** page for the Mod Installation section received a much-needed update. I rephrased and rearranged parts of it. "**Clean Example.esp**" as a possible instruction is no longer referenced and it was also removed from the Basic Instructions page. We have been removing ITMs manually for some time now which is preferable to -QAC in my opinion. ITMs are not always unnecessary and they are rarely problematic. The entire process of "cleaning" plugins, especially with -QAC, is massively overrated.

On the other hand, there is now a "**ESL-ify Example.esp**" instruction that you may now encounter throughout the guide instead of at the end under Finalisation. The reason for this is that we have one plugin (QW's Grass Patch) that depends on ESL-ified versions of the Veydosebrom, Folkvangr, and Cathedral 3D Pine Grass plugins. When opened in SSEEdit with non-ESL-ified dependencies it may throw errors that are only fixable by a reinstall. Thus, mods that are supposed to be ESL-ified are now ESL-ified right after they are installed.

An added benefit of having the ESL-ify instructions on the Mod Installation pages is that I stop forgetting to remove a plugin from the "list of plugins to ESL-ify" when the mod they belong to is removed. This does happen all the time. It is also easier for people to catch when they reinstall a mod for whatever reason.

While going through the guide to move the "ESL-ify plugin" instructions where necessary, I also added a link to the Basic Instructions page to *all* Basic Instructions. If you closed the page and can't find it again, you got a direct link now.

**Base Coat:**

I removed it, you're welcome. About two thirds of it were overwritten so I dug up some decent retextures for things that were not, then ditched the whole package. That's about ~30GB freed up.

**Mod order:**

It seems I messed up the numbers when I added the Loot & Crafting page to the Mod Installation section. Since the pages from that section are supposed to correspond to the mod order in MO2, this is rather problematic. Here is the correct order (which the pages are now in as well):

- Gameplay Overhauls
- Loot & Crafting
- Non-Player Characters
- Improved Vanilla Quests
- Combat & Encounters

#### Update Instructions

**This update is save-safe.**

Please update the [CAO - Basic Profiles Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26092?tab=files). Right-click **No Heavy Muscular Walk and Idle** in your mod order, select **Reinstall** and **Replace**. Run the mod once again through CAO (Optimise SLE Assets profile). Previously, the profile did not have processing of animations enabled, meaning the mod was not properly ported. Sorry about that.

Please also redo all LODs (that includes terrain LOD). Instructions are [on this page](/tpf/guide-resources/how-to-update/).

## Release 4.7

> 11/08/2021

With this update, we are doing some spring cleaning. Several mods that we consider to be problematic (Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions) or out of place in TPF (Reliquary of Myth, Obscure's College of Winterhold) have been removed. On the other hand, I added **Apothecary**, Simon and Delta's new SimonRim alchemy and food overhaul. These changes all require **a new playthrough** which is why this update is a major release.

I also (finally) added the -IKnowWhatImDoing argument for SSEEdit (so that the warning window is skipped). I removed the "click yes to warning" instruction in as many places as I could find it, but might have missed some.

**About the ENB change:**

In this update, we are swapping back to Serio's ENB and removing the Cathedral Weather edits for Rudy ENB. I've decided that base TPF will simply stick with Serio's going forward and the upcoming Wabbajack-only version of TPF-X will be using Rudy ENB. I'm really sorry about the back-and-forth in this matter, it's caused by my own indecisiveness. I'm relatively sure there will not be any more ENB changes in the (near) future though.

**About the visual changes:**

Thanks to a user suggestion, I finally gave [Tamrielic Textures - Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32973) a shot and was thoroughly impressed. We are now using the mod for the vast majority of landscape textures (which is why this update requires regenerating terrain LOD). I also swapped to Enhanced Vanilla Trees Lush (instead of Custom) because those meshes work better with non-EVT bark retextures. I really dislike the default EVT bark texture so I'm happy we finally have a different one.

I also officially swapped the guide over to Folkvangr + Veydosebrom + Cathedral 3D Pine Grass with QW Grass Patch as this combination is pretty damn perfect in my eyes. It is the only grass mod combination I am truly happy with in all areas of Skyrim.

**About (some of) the removed mods:**

A good chunk of the mods removed in this update are going to re-appear in TPF-X. The point of 4.7 is to "purify" it as a base setup with as little added content as possible while TPF-X does add content (such as new enemy types or items). The reasons for the removal of Realistic AI Detection as well as several content-related mods can be found in [**this Patreon post**](https://www.patreon.com/posts/august-update-54701613).

With the removal of Reliquary of Myth and Unique Item Tweaks, we have once again reverted to vanilla artifacts. They are not ideal, but ROM's effects are more suited to EnaiRim setups; they feel out of place in SimonRim. I'm confident there will be a v+ artifact overhaul released one day that can then finally cover uniques in TPF.

Finally a number of mods had to be removed because they were deleted from the Nexus due to recent drama.

**About the difficulty change:**

The vanilla difficulty modifiers addon for Blade & Blunt is now part of TPF. This is because occasionally users complain about tough combat while absolutely refusing to lower the game difficulty out of a misplaced sense of pride. TPF combat with Blade and Blunt (and some other mods) is more challenging than vanilla, and you should never feel bad for lowering the difficulty in order to have fun. I believe that as a v+ list, TPF should not be (much) harder than vanilla anyway.

You can disable the plugin anytime to play with Adamant's adjusted difficulty levels for tougher combat.

## Release 4.6.2

> 06/07/2021

As it turns out the [**Aspens Ablaze Billboards**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51135) played a huge role in the performance issues present in the latest versions of TPF. The performance loss could be as high as 20FPS which I do not consider worth the visual improvement. In fact, I would argue that the original billboards blend better with the non-LOD trees. Check this [**comparison slider**](https://imgsli.com/NjAxMDM) to see the difference in both visuals and performance. The mod was removed from TPF and, as a result of that, your framerate in the Rift should be much improved.

**The performance impact of TPF 4.6.2 is still larger than in 4.5.x and earlier versions.** However, the performance guide really should fix this for most people; particularly regenerating INI files on BethINI Medium and/or regenerating DynDOLOD without 3D tree LOD should help.

Otherwise, the alchemy workbenches are fixed (reinstall and run Revamped Assets Skyrim through SSE NIF Optimizer instead of CAO) and you should no longer fall to your death during Meridia's quest (remove havok tweak from your skyrimcustom.ini file).

#### How to Update

- Regenerate TexGen and DynDOLOD ([instructions](https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/guide-resources/how-to-update/#dyndolod)).
- You can keep your old Occlusion output, but disable it while you regenerate TexGen and DynDOLOD.
- **Wabbajack:** Also copy over GFF again (ENBSeries binaries updated).

#### Initial Setup

- **Additional Tools:** Removed zEdit (no longer needed for any steps).

#### Mod Installation

- **Interface:** Removed Loading Screen Smoke Removed.
- **Interface:** Added Menu and Load Smoke Removed for ENB.
- **Interface:** Removed KenMOD - Time on Loading Screen (file was removed from the Nexus).
- **Graphics Baseline:** Now using SSE NIF Optimizer instead of CAO on Revamped Assets Skyrim.
- **Trees & Plants:** Removed Aspens Ablaze Add-On - DynDOLOD 3 (unreasonable performance impact).
- **Trees & Plants:** Removed INI Tweaks for Cathedral - 3D Pine Grass (they are fairly unnecessary).
- **Architecture:** Updated download instructions for Shingles - Alpha Patch (file name changed).
- **Interiors:** Now using the 1K textures instead of 2K for SD's Horn Candles.
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Fixed download instructions for Stalhrim Refrozen.
- **Improved Vanilla Quests:** Updated download instructions for Andrealphus' Tweaks - Harder Quests (file names updated).
- **Skeleton & Animations:** Updated additional instructions for Simple Dual Sheath (lines changed).
- **Skeleton & Animations:** Removed INI tweak instructions for Jumping Behaviour Overhaul (would kill you during Meridia's quest).

#### Performance Guide

- Added a new INI tweak that can be done instead of regenerating BethINI from scratch.
- Elaborated on which setting godrays should be set to in the BethINI settings.
- Added instructions to lower the fBlockLevel1Distance value when reconfiguring INIs through BethINI.
- Removed grass density tweak from the BethINI instructions (leave at default).
- Added grass density instructions to the Grass Overhaul section.
- Fixed a pretty bad typo in the DynDOLOD section (use the Performance profile, not the Optimal one).

#### Conflict Resolution Patch

- Re-enabled one of the temper recipes for the Champion's Cudgel (we have three and all three were, somehow, disabled).
- Forwarded new Adamant keywords for bound equipment (4.6.1.1).
- Disabled WACCF's alternative iron helmet (4.6.1.2).

#### Wabbajack

- Updated ENBSeries (version number unchanged)
- Updated Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes to 2.3
- Updated Shingles - Alpha Patch to 1.2.0
- Updated Adamant - A Perk Overhaul to 5.0.3

- Updated Simple Dual Sheath to 1.4.1
- Replaced Beast Race Vampire Fang Removal SLE with SSE version

## Release 4.6.1

> 29/06/2021

Here is the first round of fixes for TPF 4.6 as expected. Since the update was larger than usual, I seem to also have messed up more (sorry). Huge thanks go to all the wonderful people who left feedback on Discord!

We are currently investigating potential performance issues going beyond the increase that we had expected to see in the update. Anybody currently experiencing performance issues should use the performance guide/profile. If you have the time, please also leave us some feedback on Discord!

#### Performance Guide

#### Wabbajack

- Updated Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes to 2.2
- Updated Adamant - A Perk Overhaul to 5.0.2
- Updated Dragon War - A Dragon Overhaul to 1.0.4

## Release 4.6

> 28/06/2021

The Phoenix Flavour 4.6 is probably the most substantial update since 4.0 came out. I'm overall very happy with everything I managed to squeeze in and for the first time since TPF originally came out, I have no immediate plans for the next update.

**Please consider 4.6 a beta release.** Like all major updates, this, too, is likely to contains oversights, typos, missing links, wrong FOMOD instructions, or my trademark cut-off sentences. Please bear with me and report your findings on Discord (`#tpf-feedback`). Wait for 4.6.1 if you'd rather have a more polished experience.

- Adamant 5 and other SimonRim updates.
- Open World Loot integration (a new loot overhaul).
- Increased performance impact due to new INI and DynDOLOD configurations.
- Rudy ENB with Rudy's Cathedral Weathers tweaks and DLVaSS are now default.
- A brand-new performance guide with various options to improve your FPS.
- Grass Cache was removed. Pre-made facegen will now be provided for download.
- Added Modular Armory which I made specifically for TPF.
- Added Simple Smithing Overhaul with some tweaks.
- More dense grass and better swamp grass.
- Much better glacier and ice assets (multilayered parallax).
- Switching from AllGUD to Simple Dual Sheath (AllGUD is now part of TPF-X).
- Roboto Font Replacer was moved to TPF-X. Sovngarde Font is now TPF default.

**About the Performance Guide:**

As you may have noticed from the above feature list, TPF 4.6 is even more demanding on your hardware than previous versions. Our INI settings are now based on the BethINI High preset and the DynDOLOD configuration is on High with 3D tree LOD by default.

However, you can still enjoy TPF on mid- to low-end hardware!

The new performance guide covers a variety of performance improvements: Regenerating INI files, the return of Cathedral Landscapes for FPS-friendly grass, ENB alternatives, a performance configuration for DynDOLOD, and optionally scaling down the resolution.

Users of the manual guide can apply whichever of the tweaks they like.

For Wabbajack, there will be a second "Performance" profile available in Mod Organizer 2 with DynDOLOD on Medium with 2D tree LOD, optimised INI settings, and less FPS-hungry grass mods. The Game Folder Files folder will also include both Rudy ENB and Serio's ENB for you to choose from.

**About Cathedral Assets Optimizer:**

CAO updated multiple times in the past weeks but there were lingering issues with each new release and they once again reverted to the (stable) 5.0.15 which we used for a long time. The guide will do the same thing.

If you used CAO 5.1.3 or 5.2.0:

- Revert to Cathedral Assets Optimizer 5.0.15.
- Go through the entire guide to find mods with CAO instructions.
- Reinstall those mods, then process them with CAO 5.0.15.

**About the removal of grass cache:**

A sizeable portion of users (including myself) has reported mild stutters caused by grass cache. There are some workarounds but they mostly defeat the point of generating grass cache to begin with. Thus I decided to drop it. It's unfortunate because grass cache is the single best way to check for repeatable crashes but there are still too many issues with it (the stutters, cells sometimes randomly don't have grass, etc).

And it means one less patcher to run so there's that.

**About the switch from AllGUD to Simple Dual Sheath:**

Recently a much simpler dual sheath mod than AllGUD was released that does not require any patching or mesh edits whatsoever. [Simple Dual Sheath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049) is just a SKSE plugin, completely plug and play. Of course, [AllGUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28833) has far more features than just dual sheaths so I did not remove it entirely. You can now find instructions for the mod and all additional steps in TPF-X.

**About the facegen changes:**

We traced down a bug with Urag gro-Shub's facegen to the Creation Kit starting to stumbled over its own feet when generating all facegen at once (in this case, the bug could be fixed by skipping the six Snow Elves when generating facegen). Since facegen apparently absolutely *has* to be generated in small batches, I figured it would be easier to simply provide pre-made facegen for everyone after all. The facegen step in Finalisation was removed entirely.

**About the music mod changes:**

I finally decided to move all mods adding to music, including my merged plugin, to TPF-X (the official TPF addon). Support and instructions for them all still exist, just not in the default guide.

#### How to update

- **New save required.**

#### Wabbajack

In 4.6, I removed the Tools folder in Mod Organizer 2. The primary reason for this is that it should not be used anyway: At least any LOD generating tools are supposed to be installed and generate output *outside* of MO2 directories. Additionally, Wabbajack users are not meant to use these tools anyway. If for whatever reason you absolutely need to rerun DynDOLOD, etc, you can refer to the manual guide for installation instructions (but there will be no support).

## Release 4.5.4

> 25/04/2021

Since More Informative Console was recently updated, I temporarily removed the Dear Diary MIC reskin in the last update (the author, uranreactor, is already aware and working on an update for the new version of MIC). Unfortunately, I forgot that my repack of those files also included the new font for the console for which the fontconfig.txt in Roboto was edited. After removing the font file with the Dear Diary - Better MIC mod, the console font was broken for everyone, whoops.

- Manual users need to reinstall Roboto to reset the config file to default.

## Release 4.5.1

> 07/04/2021

Fixes for 4.5 as expected. Thanks to everyone on Discord who gave feedback and reported issues!

This version will also be available on Wabbajack shortly.

**Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers:**

As mountain flowers go [these](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312) are probably the most elaborate out there. I was very impressed by the new models and textures, and added them to TPF a few versions ago. Since then I've played the game quite a bit with them installed and I can no longer deny that they simply stick out. I just realised that their ESM has a bunch of conflicts with Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes that I somehow managed to miss so that was the final nail in the coffin. The mod was removed in this update (not patching conflicts for a mod that's about to be removed anyway). Instead I added Skyrim Flora Overhaul (only the plant retextures) which is still an improvement over vanilla.

**Double enchantments:**

Up until very recently, double enchantments in Skyrim were bugged. This affected the Solstheim "Chaos Damage" enchantment (fire, frost, and shock) as well as the "Fortify <school\> & Magicka Regen" enchantment from the base game. These enchantments could be learned by the player, but when the player applied them to equipment, only one of the effects actually scaled with their Enchanting skill level while the other remained at "Novice" strength.

Previously this was worked around by the mod [Enchanting Adjustments](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8473) which replaced the enchantments learnt by single ones (Shock Damage for Chaos Damage and Fortify <school\> for Fortify <school\> + Magicka Regen). A better implementation might have been to flag all items with these enchantments as not disenchantable but that is far more work and creates compatibility issues.

Either way, this fix is no longer necessary because **KernalsEgg**, author of the new and brilliant [Scrambled Bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532) mod, actually fixed it. I edited Enchanting Adjustment accordingly (through the CRP) so you can once again learn and use the double enchantments in question.

#### Mod Installation

- **Wrapping Up:** Removed UniqueBorderGates-All-BetterDGEntrance.esp from the list of plugins to ESL-ify (removed from the guide).

## Release 4.5

> 06/04/2021

It is done! TPF 4.5 is the biggest update since 4.0 and I spent altogether too long chewing on it. As a result, the risk of me having missed something (typos, unfinished sentences, any sort of weirdness) is even higher than usual. Therefore I would ask you to consider TPF 4.5 a **beta release** that will probably get some much needed polishing in 4.5.1 and potentially further small updates.

- Thanks to No Grass In Objects and grass cache, we now have extended grass range which allows for better distant blending.
- TPF is now using the new DynDOLOD 3.0 which is still in Alpha but perfectly functional.
- Some mods (Extended UI, QuickLoot) were moved to the new addon, TPF-X.
- Added new enemy types, a better console UI, an overhaul for Shouts, tweaks for bounties and quest rewards, and more.
- **This update is NOT save-safe.** You must start a new game.

**Removed mods:**

- **Prince and the Pauper:** While the FOMOD includes a Gamwich retexture option, most of the included clothing is still painfully low res. There *is* an upscale on the Nexus but frankly it cannot really be described as a visual improvement. I prefer having a smaller collection of children's clothing with consistently high quality textures.
- **JK's Cities Lite:** Has some issues with clipping and flickering that I cannot fix (no permissions) and the author of the lite version has been inactive for a long, long time.
- **Arthmoor's town additions:** Aka Arthmoor's awkwardly-squeezed-in houses. They don't look great and nobody is going to actually notice that some NPCs don't have homes.
- **Cathedral Landscapes:** A great concept that never received the updates and improvements it desperately needed. We switched to other mods that offer better grass and a similar degree of distant blending with custom terrain LOD.

#### Initial Setup

- **INI Files:** Godrays should always be set to "High" now.
- **INI Files:** Removed Grass Fade tweak (covered by No Grass In Objects).

## Global Site Update

> 08/03/2021

I finally did some spring cleaning. For the longest time it annoyed me that in my original folder structure I had categorised pages by games, for example the TPF part of the website was called "Skyrim SE" in the top menu. But what if I want to start another SE project? And you don't want to know the chaos in my pictures folder either.

The reason I hesitated for so long to change the folder names is because it breaks every, single, link. And while fixing the internal links and file paths was merely a minor annoyance, fixing all external links is more difficult - especially considering that other people may link to TPF as well and those links are now broken. Of course I also need to recompile both TPF and WTP for Wabbajack to update the links that open automatically upon installing a Wabbajack list.

Well, I finally updated now and I'm very happy with the changes. It likely will take some time for all external links to get fix plus I suspect I may have missing some internal links and file paths.

#### Changes

- Removed the Bioware section (see below).
- Renamed "Skyrim SE" to "The Phoenix Flavour" (link changed from skyrim-se to tpf).
- Renamed "Fallout 4" to "Welcome to Paradise" (link changed from fallout to wtp).
- Updated all internal links and file paths - hopefully.
- Cleaned up my pictures folder to remove any pictures that are no longer in the guide.
- Updated the home page, it has two buttons now and a combination of the TPF and WTP pics.

#### Bioware

The current state of things is that I have published a guide for ME1 with a draft for an ME2 version waiting for revision. But here's the thing: Modding Bioware games is quite different from modding Bethesda games. I've only really dipped my toes in it and wouldn't call myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination. Something I often criticise about various smaller Skyrim modding "guides" is that their authors barely know what they're doing. It occured to me that my Mass Effect "guides" are in essence the same thing ~~with better formatting~~.

To keep a longer story short, I have developed a strong sense of imposter syndrome over those excursions into Bioware land that is causing me a fair amount of stress. Something I've learned over the past couple years is that if you have too many things putting pressure on you at once, cut out everything that's non-essential. Well, this time the scissors are for the Bioware section of the TPF website.

## Release 4.4.2

> 07/03/2021

This update contains some more 4.4 fixes but also a bigger update for the **Cathedral Armory - TPF Repack**. Specifically, I added Armor Mesh Fixes and added meshes from the existing Cath Armory patch to my repack.

I also added **Practical Female Armor** meshes patched for Cath Armory by **Asator**. Several armors will no longer have boobplates: Nordic Carved, Elven, Steel Plate, and Wolf. These are in my opinion the worst offenders and the ones that actually annoy me. I may add PFA meshes for Ebony armor in the future.

## Release 4.4

> 04/03/2021

**Removal of High Poly Vanilla Hair:** This mod was TEMPORARILY removed as the current version has clipping issues on vanilla heads. The author only tested with High Poly Head but unfortunately did not set that as a requirement. They are apparently working on a fix and the mod will be re-added when that fix is available.

**Removal of Forgotten Retex Project:** While this is a great compilation of various mods, I prefer to hand-pick at the end of the day. As more conflicting mods were added, the list of files to delete from this mod grew further and I decided to simply remove it. Similar to HMB II (Cathedral NPCs) many of the mod previously included in the big package were now re-added separately.

**Removal of Skyrim 3D Misc - Tanning Rack:** Ok, so hear me out. Mathy does great work. Incredible meshes. They are so good, in fact, that every time I come across a tanning rack, I can't help thinking "that's a 2021 mesh in my 2011 game". Yes, I removed a mod because it's too well made.

**Removal of Practical Female Armor Changes:** This one will upset people, and trust me, the return of the boobplate doesn't make me happy either. But with the PFA meshes and Cath Armory meshes, and lacking the skills to implement the changes from either mod into the other, I had to make a decision. Will probably be re-added at some point when I've figured out how to patch the meshes.

#### Updating Instructions

## Release 4.3.2

> 25/02/2021

The update is **save-safe**. Upon loading a save, you will be warned about a "missing plugin" because the CRP was renamed. Since the plugin is still present (only under a different name) and had no direct masters, this is harmless and you can simply click OK.

#### Initial Setup

- **Mod Organizer 2:** Added instructions to download the old 2.3.2 version of Mod Organizer 2.

*Support for MO2 2.4.0 will come eventually but we will wait until most Antivirus tools have flagged the new version as harmless in their databases. They are known to quarantine parts or the entirety of MO2, usually because of the UVFS.*

*LOD and Occlusion were not regenerated.*

## Release 4.3.1

> 24/02/2021

No changes to the manual guide or Wabbajack (although an actual content update is coming soon).

I added a new section called [**TPF Addons**](/tpf/tpf-addons/) to officially feature the various Addons created by third parties. These range from integration patches (Legacy of the Dragonborn and Creation Club content) to small collections to be installed on top of an existing TPF setup. Sr Kaio's and D1Z4STR's Addons are for the small touches while Slidikins' Strenuous Skyrim is made to increase the overall difficulty. Different Addons cater to different tastes!

**If you are interested in Addons:** Please, please read the [Addon Primer](/tpf/tpf-addons/addon-primer) I wrote before installing anything. The page will take you through the rest of the section and supply you with everything you need to know.

I am also working on an Addon of my own with some changes that I cannot put into the main guide. Stay tuned for updates!

## Release 4.1.1

> 13/02/2021

#### Mod Installation

- **Food & Ingredients:** Actually removed Unique Stros M'Kai Rum from the mod installation section.

## Release 4.1

> 10/02/2021

As it turns out, the Timing Is Everything preset feature is broken. I hadn't previously noticed it as I didn't check *all* the pages and on the "Extras" page everything seemed to work well. Umgak fixed that in scripts packaged with the CRP. The preset itself was updated for even better synergy with other mods in TPF, ensuring quests will not be available before you are capable of beating them. Details can be found on the new [Quests](/tpf/gameplay-guide/quests) page in the Gameplay Guide.

While working on the Quests segment of the Gameplay Guide, I noticed that it was rather inconsistent to use Andrealphus' Dawnguard DLC integration option for the Stones of Barenziah (No Stones Unturned) but not the Dragonborn DLC one. So I fixed that.

#### Mod Installation

- **Landscape:** Changed Blended Roads instructions to simply use the Medieval Bridges optional file.
- **Food & Ingredients:** Removed Unique Stros M'Kai Rum (encountered a CTD in connection with it that needs further investigating).
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Added instructions to install the new hotfix for LeanWolf's Better-Shaped Weapons.

#### Mod Configuration

- Rephrased instructions for Timing Is Everything so applying the preset no longer feels optional.

#### Gameplay Guide

- **Quests:** Added a new page to cover changes to quests, level requirements, etc.

#### Conflict Resolution Patch

With the removal of Fuz Ro D'oh and new instructions for Keyboard Shortcuts Fix, the Clean-up page has essentially become redundant and was removed.

## Release 4.0 Beta 6

> 29/01/2021

With this update, **Alternate Start - Live Another Life** (aka AS LAL), got the boot. Gonna be honest here, I've been meaning to remove that mod for a long, long time. Unfortunately, there never was a simple alternative to it that just puts you in a quiet place to go through MCM settings and character creation before the vanilla start. And, spoiler alert, there still isn't.

However, I discovered that the vanilla start - once a buggy mess in modded games - works perfectly fine in TPF. This is due to the fact that most mods no longer instantly fire all their scripts as soon as you start the game and we have very few mods that run many scripts anyway. The overall stability of SSE and the decoupling of framerate and physics are helping here as well.

Without AS LAL, everyone is forced to go through the vanilla intro which makes balancing far easier for us. There is simply no way we can balance every single one of AS LAL's starting points so that it's a fair start for a new playthrough. I always recommended the vanilla start anyway. Additionally, AS LAL touches so many parts of Skyrim that it's essentially patching hell. Now we are rid of that, too.

The downside is that there is no quiet mod configuration spot before you are thrown into the game anymore. You will probably have to take a breather after escaping Helgen or later in Riverwood for the MCM stuff. I miss the convenience of the AS LAL cell but it's a small part of the mod and doesn't justify keeping the rest.

**Website structure:** As you may have noticed, I moved around some pages and added a new (WIP) Wabbajack page. The purpose of this is to have a clear distinction of guide sections for manual and for WJ users.

#### Introduction

- Temporarily removed link to mod spreadsheet (very outdated, will get to it).
- Added link to the new [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj_QypS-aCNNyUBLpYsFAeCJk1Zq0xnmV) with music tracks added by mods in TPF.
- Expanded the Wabbajack section and added a FLOWCHART to make it obvious which sections WJ users need to follow.

#### Initial Setup

- **Mod Organizer 2:** Rewrote the Separator section to have DIY instructions (users make their own separators).
- **ESM Cleaning:** Actually fixed Dawnguard manual cleaning instructions (could have sworn I already did this).
- **ESM Cleaning:** Added note to uncheck SSEEdit Backups so that they don't clutter up your Overwrite.

*For Beta Testers: Re-cleaning Dawnguard.esm is not necessary. The problem was that I had custom Filter profiles that I thought were default. Users didn't have them though, so I had to rewrite the instructions without using a filter.*

#### Mod Installation

- **Instructions:** Added paragraph on creating new separators for each new page in the mod installation section.
- **Essential Mods:** Removed Alternate Start - Live Another Life (praise the Nine).
- **Fixes:** Updated FOMOD instructions for Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods (no longer selecting the AS LAL patch).
- **Tweaks:** Removed Multiple Floors Sandboxing (added to ACC).
- **Graphics Baseline:** Fixed file names in additional instructions for aMidianBorn Book of Silence.
- **Graphics Baseline:** Added instructions to delete the scripts folder from aMidianBorn Book of Silence.

- **Dungeons:** Added instructions to Underground to fix the shiny mud in Helgen.
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Fixed download instructions for Sunhallowed and Bloodcursed Arrows (Optional Files > Main Files).
- **Miscellaneous:** Removed Bounty Previews (late note from Beta 1, will be re-added very soon).

#### Finalisation

- **Wrapping Up:** Added instructions to create a new separator before installing the CRP.
- **Wrapping Up:** Removed sandboxcylinderheight.esp from list of plugins to ESL-ify (added to ACC).
- **Nemesis:** Added instructions to add a PATCHER OUTPUT separator.
- **DynDOLOD:** Added instructions to click "Advanced" in the window that comes up when *not* generating 3D tree LOD.
- **Occlusion:** Improved instructions for generating Occlusion (minor rephrasing).
- **First Launch:** Updated for the removal of Alternate Start.
- **Clean-Up:** Moved instructions to check MO2 for errors here.

#### New Game

- This section was completely removed.
- Most of the FINAL STEPS page was redundant except for the MO2 error check which was moved to Clean-up instead.
- The MOD CONFIGURATION page is now a top-level page.
- The GAMEPLAY GUIDE page is now a top-level page.

#### Wabbajack

- Added this new top-level page with instructions for the Wabbajack version of TPF.

#### Mod Configuration

- **Mod Configuration:** This is now a top-level page.
- **Mod Configuration:** Temporarily removed the (fairly pointless) instructions for GIST. Will add proper ones in the future.

#### Gameplay Guide

- **Gameplay Guide:** This is now a top-level page.
- **Gameplay Guide:** Added a far too detailed section about the music mods added in TPF.

## Release 4.0 Beta 5

> 26/01/2021

As you may have noticed, the **ENBSeries** section has vanished from the sidebar. What happened? It was reintegrated. Everything from those pages was moved back into the main body of the guide with ENBMan, binaries, and preset installation being a step in the Finalisation. This was done in order to further streamline the guide and eliminate optional paths and variations.

Also removed was **Nether's Follower Framework** after some internal discussions. Overtime, NFF has grown from a lightweight follower overhaul to an excessively bloated mod doing all kinds of things. While it remains high quality, the vast majority of features are misplaced in a v+ setup. Additionally, combat is easier for us to balance knowing that players are limited to a single follower like in vanilla. Some features of NFF were replaced by other mods.

**New save required** once again because of the removal of NFF. Sorry. =(

## Release 4.0 Beta 1

> 20/01/2021

Update 4.0 for The Phoenix Flavour is firmly taking the setup back to its "vanilla plus" roots. TPF is committing to low-impact mods that blend in well while doubling down on our performance-friendly visual enhancements. Many mods were removed in this update, some of the beloved favourites, but there are solid reasons behind each removal.

New mods include the custom made **Armor Variants Lite** which is an alternative to kryptopyr's CCOR-dependent aMidianBorn Content Addon, created by Umgak from scratch. I also re-added the much requested artifact overhaul **Reliquary of Myth** and completely rebuilt the appearance section which is now centered around **Cathedral NPCs**. And finally Fore's New Idles was replaced with the more recent and open source **Nemesis**.

**Removal of CBBE:** I only ever included CBBE because many people demanded it. It's not required by anything and half the time I have no idea whether a CBBE patch is required or not. I haven't noticed a difference between CBBE / vanilla body in regular gameplay, ever, and I'm sick of worrying that something might not work correctly. I have no idea how to use BodySlide and frankly, I'm not interested in figuring it out. At this point, CBBE is for me personally just additional headache for zero gain. Well, I guess my character's buttcheeks are low-poly now but I can just about live with that.

**Removal of CCOR and RDO:** Both Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered and Relationship Dialogue Overhaul were removed in this update because of feature creep. In the case of CCOR, the feature creep is subtle but enough to disturb my V+ vibes. Almost all the features that I personally like were implemented by other means with a faction equipment crafting module being on my to do list. RDO was never properly ported to SSE to begin with, nobody is creating patches for it, and it touches a million different things. The effort of integrating it is almost comparable to CRF. I personally doubt I will even notice if it's missing so I removed it as well.

**Removal of ENB Lights:** While it adds some cool effects, I removed ENB Lights for the time being as it is somewhat annoying to handle. It edits plenty of meshes (which means added compatibility work) and isn't properly updated for some of the newer fire mods. I'll likely come back to this mod and reimplement parts of it in a later 4.x update.

**Removal of the Content Addon:** Since [Elysium](https://github.com/TitansBane/Elysium) is now a thing, I no longer feel any sort of pressure to add new content to TPF. First and foremost, the list is intended to improve the gameplay, balancing, and graphics of the base game (and that's difficult enough!). Some extra content mods are still in the guide (those adding equipment variants) as I cannot imagine playing without them.

#### Introduction

## 16/07/2023

#### Quick Start

I moved the "Building your setup" page to a separate page and renamed it to [Quick Start](/bg/quick-start/). This is intended to be a short summary of steps to be taken when building a setup, based on my personal process.

The structure of the guide is mostly in place but it is missing a lot of the detail. I am planning to write separate pages / guides on nearly every step in the process which will be added gradually.

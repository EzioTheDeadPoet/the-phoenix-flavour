## Curation Club

**Curation Club** is a plugin for Mod Organizer 2 which simplifies importing Creations as mods.

- Download the latest main file of [Curation Club](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60552?tab=files) (click **Mod Manager Download**).    
- In MO2, switch to the **Downloads** tab in the right pane.
- Right-click the downloaded mod and select **Open File**.
- Extract the **curationclub** folder to `\Mod Organizer 2\plugins\`.

{{< alert color="warning" >}}To quickly access the **plugins** folder, you can click [the folder icon](/Pictures/bg/mo2-plugins-folder-shortcut.png) above the left pane and select **Open MO2 Plugins Folder**.{{< /alert>}}

- Restart Mod Organizer 2.

## Importing Creations

Running **Curation Club** through Mod Organizer 2 will now import all creations present in your default (Steam) installation folder into Mod Organizer 2 where you can manage them like any other mod.

{{< alert color="warning" >}} Because **Curation Club** moves the creations out of the data folder rather than creating copies, you may want to create a backup first. Just copy all files starting with cc from `\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\` to a convenient location.{{< /alert >}}

Run **Curation Club**.

The default naming scheme `Creation Club - {creation}` is perfect for me (but feel free to change it to your preferences).

If you are following the Core Module or if you are already using Root Builder, check the box for **Root Builder Support**.

Click **OK** to import your creations.

{{< alert color="success" >}} You can now manage your Creations through Mod Organizer 2 like any other mod.{{< /alert >}}

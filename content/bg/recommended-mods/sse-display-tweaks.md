## About the mod

If you have a very high-res monitor (i.e., 4K) you may want to consider running the game at a lower resolution. Skyrim scales badly and even with powerful hardware, it can be a challenge to achieve 60FPS in a heavily modded game at 1440p. With mid-tier hardware I would recommend going no higher than 1440p.

{{< alert color="warning" >}}If you set a resolution in the SSE Display Tweaks custom INI that is **lower** than your monitor's native resolution, you also need to add the following line:{{< /alert >}}

```
BorderlessUpscale=true
```

Performance adjustments such as this one can also be left for later when you have a better idea of what your modded setup runs like.

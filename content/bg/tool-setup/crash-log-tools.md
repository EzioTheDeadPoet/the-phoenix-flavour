## About Crash Log Tools

**Crash Log Tools** is a plugin for Mod Organizer 2 which adds the ability to view crash logs generated by [Crash Logger](/bg/recommended-mods/utilities-frameworks/#crash-logger) directly through the MO2 UI. This is far more convenient than navigating manually to where the logs are saved under `\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\`.

In addition, the plugin will attempt to label known addresses in crash logs which may help with tracking down the cause of a crash.

### Installation

Crash Log Tools is available on the Nexus.

- Download the latest version of [Crash Log Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66743?tab=files).

- **Close Mod Organizer 2.**
